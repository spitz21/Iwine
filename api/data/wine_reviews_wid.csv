0,1,98,M. Chapoutier 1999 Le Méal Ermitage  (Hermitage),"Chapoutier's selections of the best parcels of vines in Hermitage are set to become legendary. Sold under the ancient spelling of the appellation name (Ermitage), they represent the epitome of the power and concentration that lies behind the reputation of the appellation. This cuvée is the best of the collection, with its brooding, opaque character, suggesting rather than revealing power at this stage. Age it until your new-born baby is old enough to drink, and it will be just about ready.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1,2,96,Colgin 1999 Herb Lamb Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Aromas lean toward black cherry, chocolate and herbs, which sally forth on the palate serving up more dense fruit, licorice, coffee and beautiful toast flavors. Tannins are smooth, supple and ripe. Long, lush and decadent on the finish.",Anonymous,
2,3,96,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 SLV Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Certainly one of the successes of the vintage. Packed with cassis, sage, plum, tobacco, earth and smoky oak, and perfectly dry and balanced. Sheer joy in the mouth, like liquid velvet. It changes every second, offering up tiers of flavors through the spicy finish.",Anonymous,
3,4,96,Dalla Valle 1999 Maya Red (Napa Valley),"Plush, smooth and packed tight with complex flavors. Blackberry, anise, black cherry, tar, coal, spice, earth and herbs remain tightly wound, waiting patiently to reveal their full charm in time. Supple, smooth tannins and beautiful balance give this wine classic elegance.",Anonymous,
4,5,96,E. Guigal 1998 La Mouline  (Côte Rôtie),"Even though the 42 months this wine has spent in new wood give it an intensely toasty character, the enormously soft, perfumed fruits and ripe, sweet flavors that go along with the wood produce a finely tuned, balanced wine that should age well over many years. As an expression of pure Syrah, there are few better.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5,6,95,E. Guigal 1998 La Turque  (Côte Rôtie),"A firm, dry, foursquare wine that has power and structure rather than the immediate perfumes of La Mouline, the partner cuvée from Guigal. This is the wine for those who want power with big tannins, and they don't come more powerful or tannic than this. Its aging potential is enormous:  after 10 years there should be more sign of the perfumed fruit which is there, somewhere.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6,7,95,Domaine Jean-Michel Gerin 1999 La Landonne  (Côte Rôtie),"Here is a superbly rich and smooth wine. Aromas of violets and flavors of blueberries and red cherries along with dusty tannins, give this wine both immediate appeal and the promise of a good long-term future.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
7,8,95,Éric & Jöel Durand 1999 Empreintes  (Cornas),"A huge, ink-black wine with all the brooding majesty that gives Cornas its reputation. A blockbuster with enormous rich, sweet tannins. At the end it is the quality of the superripe fruit from old vines that dominates, but it is certainly a wine to keep for generations.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
8,9,95,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Cask 23 Red (Napa Valley),"What a great success. Oozes with blackcurrant jam and cassis and a dash of black pepper. Flamboyant oak adds a perfume of vanilla and smoke. Fleshy, long and full, this beautiful wine is not a monster, but it coats the palate with spicy flavors that epitomize class and style.",Anonymous,
9,10,94,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 1999 Chevalier de Sterimberg White (Hermitage),"Jaboulet's white Hermitage is named after the crusading knight who built and settled in the small chapel on the Hermitage hill. The wine itself is powerful, rich and concentrated, with heady perfumes of wild flowers and nuts. The palate combines a hint of wood, a full-bodied, oily texture and a stunning burst of acidity that leaves a crisp aftertaste.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
10,11,94,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 1999 La Chapelle  (Hermitage),"Jaboulet's view of its most famous wine seems to have changed. Although the concentrated, dense tannins and big black fruit flavors are still there, it has lost the huge brooding presence of past vintages, and now has a veneer of sophistication with superripe fruit, plums and dark jam tastes. Whether this 1999 will age as well as older vintages remains to be seen, but it will certainly be ready to drink sooner.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
11,12,94,Delas Frères 1999 Les Bessards  (Hermitage),"Old vines in the Les Bessards vineyard on the Hermitage hill have offered up a majestic wine that has considerable power. With its strong, firm tannins and intense, brooding dark fruits, this is a wine that has obviously been made to last. With little use of new wood for this wine (only 10%), the structure and the complexity come entirely from the enormously ripe fruit and traditional fermentation.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
12,13,94,E. Guigal 1999 Brune et Blonde  (Côte Rôtie),"The perfect combination of elegance and purity of fruit give this famous wine, a blend of fruit from both slopes of the hills above Ampuis, a great sense of style as well as power. The Syrah perfumes, at their richest and coolest, combine with black fruits to give an overwhelming impression of immense fruit flavors.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
13,14,94,Hedges 1999 Red Mountain Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hedges is one of a handful of Washington wineries producing top- caliber wines in significant quantities. This is their best deeply colored, elegant and Bordeaux-like in style and substance. Powerful, muscular black cherry fruit blends with dense, firm tannins, highlighted with elements of iron and earth. The wine, though young and compressed, is a perfect expression of Red Mountain Cabernet. About 20% Merlot is also in the blend. 2,100 six-bottle cases made. Editors' Choice.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
14,15,90,Montes 2010 Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"This SB has one of Chile's best track records for high quality. The nose and flavors both exceed norms, with the former showing bold citrus, lime and melon aromas and the latter revolving around grapefruit, lime and gooseberry. It's ripe, healthy, pithy, acid-driven and piercing. Summer sipping calls.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
15,16,90,Dr. Loosen 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Loosen's 2009 spätlese from the Wehlener Sonnenuhr is a lush, medium-bodied wine loaded with honey and peaches. It's superripe and succulent, with a long, fruity finish. Try it with Szechuan dishes, which will buffer the sweetness of the wine while the wine tames some of the heat.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
16,17,90,Dry River 2009 Late Harvest Riesling (Martinborough),"Plump and slightly sweet, this late-harvest Riesling comes in at 10% alcohol—something along the lines of a rich spätlese in terms of its alcohol-acid-sugar balance. Notes of pineapple and crushed stone open up to melon fruit on the palate and finish long, with a bit of cinnamon or ginger spice.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
17,18,90,Kingston Family 2009 Alazan Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Always at the top of the Chilean Pinot heap is this true, complex wine from Kingston Family. The nose features light raspberry, citrus, oceanic brine and toasty, creamy oak. The palate is lush and rolls across the tongue with ease; ripe fruit in the cherry zone along with cocoa and spice make for fine flavors. Finishes with purity, smooth tannins and herbal twinges.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
18,19,90,Kumeu River 2008 Coddington Chardonnay (Kumeu),"Perhaps the biggest of Kumeu River's 2008 Chardonnays, the Coddington offers waves of tropical fruit—pineapple and carambola—allied to mouthfilling richness and balanced by citrusy acids and hints of roasted nuts. Drink now.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
19,20,90,Nanni Copé 2008 Sabbie di Sopra il Bosco Red (Terre del Volturno),"Here's a new producer from southern Italy who presents a very interesting blend of Pallagrello (70%), Aglianico and Casavecchia. The wine opens with warm aromas of leather, smoked meat and black fruit and delivers a unique mouthfeel that is firm but rich at the same time.",Anonymous,
20,21,90,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2009 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel),"Like the Josephshöfer bottling, von Kesselstatt's 2009 GG from the Piesporter Goldtröpfchen boasts a salty minerality that underscores the ripe flavors of peach and orange zest.

21,22,90,S.A. Prüm 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Makes an interesting contrast with the J.J. Prüm bottling from the same site, weighing in at a full 1.5% less in finished alcohol, and showing mineral-inflected passion fruit flavors and a touch of vanilla. The sweetness is finely balanced by mouthwatering acidity on the finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
22,23,90,Errazuriz 2008 The Blend Limited Edition Red (Aconcagua Valley),"Alluring on the nose, with a ton of dried spice, mocha and tobacco aromas to go with beefy, berry fruit notes. Despite its darkness and size, this wine delivers bright, juicy acidity and then herbal cassis and berry flavors. Tobacco, herbs and length define the finish. A blend of five red grapes, including Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot; drink now through 2013.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
23,24,90,Feudi di San Gregorio 2009 Pietracalda  (Fiano di Avellino),"Pietracalda (which translates into “hot rock”) seems indeed to release aromas of sunbaked granite or river stone over lush background tones of peach, pear and yellow lemon zest. There's a drying, polished feel in the mouth with a touch of bitter almond on the close.",Anonymous,
24,25,90,Fournier Père et Fils 2009 Côtes de Morogues  (Menetou-Salon),"Particularly intense on the herbaceous front, the wine shows rich grapefruit and lemon zest flavors. Long, deep and delicious.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

27,28,90,Hartenberg 2007 The Stork Shiraz (Stellenbosch),"Medium weight with a satiny smooth texture and great balance, this is a stellar Syrah with great complexity between the rich dark fruit flavors and forest spice.

28,29,90,Archery Summit 2008 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A fine, elegant Pinot Noir, still in its infancy, with bright cranberry and raspberry fruit taking center stage. A shimmering, vivid, youthful vitality elevates the fruit flavors, with juicy acidity and restrained oak influence. Though this is the least expensive wine in the Archery Summit portfolio, it may surprise those who cellar it. Some extra years in the bottle could bring out unsuspected depth and power.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
29,30,90,Würtz 2008 Geyerscheiss Riesling (Rheinhessen),"A unique style of Riesling, naturally fermented on the skins for 20 days prior to pressing. The result is intriguing: honey and baked apple notes tinged with peach-like ripeness and briny minerality. It's medium-bodied, crisp and dry yet with a sense of honeyed richness.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz

33,34,90,Lange 2009 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Young and loaded with primary fruit flavors—fresh-picked cherries right off the tree, red delicious apples, just-made cranberry sauce—this is lovely now but built for the long term.

35,36,89,Huber 2007 Bombacher Sommerhalde R Trocken Spätburgunder (Baden),"Toasty and dark-fruited, Huber's 2007 Bombacher Sommerhalde R falls somewhere between the Wildenstein and Malterdinger Bienenberg in style. It's less herbal and more powerful than the former, but not as muscular as the latter. The tannins are still silky, yet there's great intensity, ending on a long, slightly charred note.

38,39,87,Tangent 2011 Paragon Vineyard Albariño (Edna Valley),"Racy and intensely flavored, this is high in acidity and has spectacularly concentrated flavors of apple, peach, citrus and tropical fruit.

Even though the residual sugar is technically zero, the finish tastes sweet, so pair it with slightly sweet foods, especially Vietnamese, Chinese or Thai.",Anonymous,
39,40,87,Tedeschi 2011 Lucchine  (Valpolicella Classico),"This is not complex or elaborate, nor is it meant to be. In fact, simplicity sums it up. It's fresh and clean, and it will drink nicely with meatloaf or pork chops.",Anonymous,

Great with a spicy Indian dish like Vindaloo—it could hold its own.",Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa
329,330,84,Graffigna 2005 Centenario Estate Bottled Malbec (San Juan),"A little reduced and granular on the nose, with black fruit and licorice aromas filling any gaps. The flavor profile is solid, with black cherry and plum pulling the cart. Where this wine comes up short is in mouthfeel; it's tight almost to the point of sharp, with a strong essence of grape skins and tannin. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
330,331,84,Vina Robles 2005 Jardine Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Ouch. Tough, extremely dry, and acidic-tannic, this wine isn't showing much charm now. There's a suggestion of blackberry, bitter cherry and blueberry fruit, as well as lots of smoky oak. Nowhere near ready, and hard to predict. Try after 2008.",Anonymous,
331,332,84,Campos Góticos 2004 Pecunia  (Ribera del Duero),"Leathery and peanutty on the nose; soon the aromas expand to baked plum and stewy berries. The palate is sturdy and tannic, but there's enough flesh and weight to the fruit that it's mostly balanced. Finishes with bacon and leather accents.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
332,333,84,Debonné 2006 Lot 707 Reserve Riesling (Grand River Valley),"A slightly floral but lively nose is followed by a pretty, balanced spice and white flower mix on the palate with this offering from Ohio. Paired with a delicate Asian dish, this wine is a fun choice.",Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa
333,334,84,Finca El Origen 2006 Reserva Malbec (Uco Valley),"Clean, fruity and a touch candied on the bouquet. The palate is narrow but saved by ripe black cherry flavors and spice notes. Finishes with a mocha-like flavor and a crisp, clean feel. A basic but more than satisfactory Malbec. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA Inc.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
334,335,84,Grgich Hills 2003 Yountville Selection Red (Napa Valley),"Grgich has struggled with this uneven bottling over the years, and the 2003 shows the problems that have plagued the wine. It combines sharpness with sugary cherry-berry flavors, making for a sweet and sour taste. There are tannins aplenty, but it doesn't seem like an ager.",Anonymous,
335,336,84,Rutini 2006 Trumpeter Malbec (Mendoza),"Sweet and a little foxy on the nose, with secondary aromas of air freshener. The flavors are a touch brambly and herbal, while the palate is flush and chewy but also a little tannic and choppy. Doesn't seem as thought this is as structured and serious as it was, say, four or five years ago.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
336,337,84,Harveys NV Orange Apéritif Sherry (Jerez),"A new take on Harveys Bristol Cream. Instead of you adding a twist of orange with the final pour, they've done it for you. But as with many infused drinks, the aromas are kind of artificial and the flavors run straight to candied and never come back. Worth a go if you like orange as a lead flavor—serve on the rocks.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
337,338,84,Wagner 2006 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"This Riesling has aromas that almost mimic a Chardonnay: toasty cream, vanilla, spice. On the palate, those more complex flavors continue, but are buoyed by some acidity and an intriguing touch of sweet flowers. Overall, a tasty sip.",Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa
338,339,84,Abadia Retuerta 2004 Selección Especial Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"At 70% Tempranillo and only 25% Cabernet and Merlot, there's a detectable green core running through the nose and palate. Surrounding that is sizable fruit and oak, the latter of which adds dill to the fray. All in all there's enough body and soul to save the wine, but along the way it's got some issues.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
339,340,84,Arrow Creek 2005 Vintner's Selection Merlot (California),"Pretty generic-tasting but basically good, a dry red wine with considerable tannins and acids that frame herbal cherry flavors.",Anonymous,
340,341,84,Hat in the Ring 2007 Fireman Shiraz (Mendoza),"Touches of cola, cherry and berry work the jammy bouquet, and the reasonably sturdy body offers up flavors of berry backed by vanilla. There's ample grab and pretty good balance to this fresh wine.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
341,342,82,Angove's 2006 Nine Vines Shiraz-Viognier (South Australia),"This wine shows strong barnyard and sulfur notes overwhelming an otherwise appealing nose of herbes de Provence and grilled pork. The palate is juicy, with appealing cherry notes while the smooth finish winds up on an ashy note.",Anonymous,
342,343,82,Henry of Pelham 2007 Reserve Off-Dry Riesling (Short Hills Bench),"This off-dry Riesling has a nose of flowers and warming spices, followed by slightly sweet and spicy fruit (apples, pears, vanilla) flavors. The wine is simple but appealing.",Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa
343,344,81,Jasper 2006 Roy's Vineyard at Cherry Creek Chancellor (Iowa),"Anyone who doesn't like barnyard smells will want to steer clear of this funky example from Iowa. The crisp palate shows some cherry notes and little tannin. Finishes with some oily, ashy notes.",Anonymous,
344,345,81,Treleaven 2007 Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake),Lime and slate notes make for a very nice opening but lead to a distractingly high level of spritz. The crisp palate is lacking in flavor and finishes on the watery side. Drink up.,Anonymous,
345,346,81,Keuka Spring 2006 Miller's Cove Red Red (Finger Lakes),"While not the best Keuka Spring has to offer, this Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend offers up some pleasant fruit compote notes and a crisp finish. The tannins are a bit grainy, however and the confected fruit flavors are on the simple side. Serve with steak, hamburgers.",Anonymous,
346,347,81,Red Mud 2007 Unoaked Chardonnay (South Australia),"Fresh but faint aromas of hay, candlewax and grass open this honest but simple effort. The palate lacks intensity but displays a bit of a mineral streak. Disappointingly short on the finish. Imported by Nelwood Wines.",Anonymous,
347,348,81,Espuela del Gaucho 2007 Gaucho Spur Malbec (Mendoza),"A lean, acidic Malbec that defies the tried and true model of richness and lots of flavor. It has rhubarb and green raspberry aromas, while the palate is short, tart and herbal. Not a lot of definition here.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
348,349,80,Alta Vista 2007 Finca Monte Lindo Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Strange Chardonnay. It smells and tastes more like feeble Torrontés than Chard. The palate offers only shearing apple fruit, and the finish is hard. Can't imagine anyone pegging this as Chardonnay.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
349,350,80,Midnight 2006 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Paso Robles),"Soft and gluey, with sweet, jammy flavors of pineapples and butterscotch. Tastes like cough drops.",Anonymous,
350,351,80,Catharine Valley 2005 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"Charming aromas of tobacco leaf and strawberries promise good things to come but the palate does not follow through. While some boysenberry flavors appeal, the wine is thin in the mouth. The tannins are a bit overly gripping now but the wine does not have the fruit ripeness or concentration to benefit from cellaring.",Anonymous,
351,352,80,Rooster Hill 2007 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Orange rind and Chinese spices make for an intriguing opener but the palate falls flat, with little to offer but a few simple lemon and lime flavors. Short finish.",Anonymous,
352,353,80,Rooster Hill 2007 Estate Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"While the aromas show some promise, they are disappointingly faint for a Gewürztraminer. This wine is an easy quaffer but lacks the palate richness typical of this variety. Crisp acidity and low alcohol (11.7%) make it a good hot weather choice.",Anonymous,
353,354,97,Iron Horse NV Joy! Sparkling (Green Valley),"Available in magnum only, this is an occasional bottling from the winery. A winery spokeperson told me my bottle was entirely 1993 vintage, but not all other bottles are. The wine is extraordinarily fine, but compared to other California bubblies, it's sandpapery and almost harsh at this point. As it warms up in the glass it shows an immense toasted nut and grilled fruit richness with an impossibly long finish. This is one to stash for the long haul.",Anonymous,
354,355,88,Château Fourcas Dupré 2012 Zenith de Fourcas Dupré  (Listrac-Médoc),"This is the second wine of Fourcas Dupré. It is soft, full of ripe berry fruits and attractive acidity. The core of the wine is still dry and shows plenty of tannic structure that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2019.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
355,356,88,Cristom 2014 Mount Jefferson Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Light raspberry fruit carries a tart punchy edge. It's clean and fresh, though showing little density. Additional bottle age (another couple of years) would be a good idea.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
356,357,88,Domaine Gerard Charvet 2015 La Réserve d'Amélie  (Moulin-à-Vent),"While it is still young, the wine is showing great fruit and soft tannins.

357,358,88,Elephant Seven 2014 River Rock Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Coming from a vineyard down in The Rocks District and at a quite low alcohol level for the state, especially considering the warmth of the vintage, this wine brings aromas of cranberry compote, herb, thistle and mineral. The flavors are light and elegant, almost faint at times, but showing a pleasing purity and a finish that lingers. It piques the interest, with cranberry juice notes lingering on the finish.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
358,359,88,Dezzani 2012 San Carlo  (Barolo),"This opens with subdued aromas of dark berry, cake spice, espresso and a whiff of pressed violet.

359,360,88,Dry Creek Vineyard 2015 Wilson Ranch Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg),This medium-bodied wine smells light and herbal. It gets deeper and richer on the palate as ripe golden-apple flavors kick in and the texture seems to spread out.,Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
360,361,88,Finca Sophenia 2015 Synthesis The Blend Red (Tupungato),"This Malbec blend is bright, jammy and grapy on the nose. The palate is juicy but bumpy and rough in feel, while fresh-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry are a little too candied and simple for a wine of this level. A ripe medicinal finish is lush but awkward.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

365,366,88,Parras Wines 2015 Quinta do Gradil Red (Lisboa),"This concentrated wine is dense with black fruits. Dark with chocolate and richness, it is still young and firm.

366,367,88,Quinta dos Poços 2014 Colheita Red (Douro),"Wood flavors dominate this young wine. It has structure and tannins, with concentrated toast and chocolate flavors. The extraction of the fruit gives the wine a bitter character. It should soften, so drink from 2019.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

381,382,92,Phillips Hill 2010 Two Terroirs Pinot Noir (Mendocino),"Phillips Hill's Two Terroirs is very subtly marked “AV + MR,” signaling that the fruit was sourced from both the cool Anderson Valley and even cooler Mendocino Ridge.

418,419,85,C&T; 2006 Skinny Dip Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Partially barrel-fermented, partly stainless steel, this is a fresh, crisp and easy white. With ripe citrus, fig, spear-mint, honey and spice flavors, it's nice as an apèritif, but will stand up to Thai or Vietnamese fare.",Anonymous,
419,420,85,De Bortoli 2007 dB Selection Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),"Full-bodied, soft in texture and loaded with peach and melon fruit, this is a tasty everyday Chard. Hints of custard and lime give it additional interest, while the finish ends on a citrusy (orange?) note. Drink now.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
420,421,85,Eden Canyon 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Not showing much succulence right now, but firm and sturdy, in keeping with the relatively cool vintage. There's green, minty taste alongside the berry, cherry and anise flavors. Could develop and soften with a year or so in the bottle.",Anonymous,
421,422,85,Herdade do Esporão 2007 Vinha de Defesa Rosé Red (Alentejano),"With its grey/pink color, aromas of cherry and raspberry and its fresh fruity flavor, this is a great apèritif rosé. The taste shows some caramel and sweet-ness, crispened with acidity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
422,423,85,Companhia das Quintas 2002 Pegos Claros Castelão (Palmela),"The local variety in Palmela is Castelão, planted in vineyards in the peninsula just south of Lisbon. It is a distinctive flavor of bright red fruits, rhubarb acidity, a core of very dry tannin and vivid mint flavors. The end brings out jam, acidity and sweet juiciness.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
423,424,85,Companhia das Quintas 2005 Quinta da Pancas Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Sauvignon (Estremadura),"Even Cabernet Sauvignon, that defiantly international variety, takes on a Portuguese character. This has that dark chocolate, high acidity and dry, but juicy character that marks so many Portuguese reds. It also has a more unfortunate volatility that is just too prominent.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
424,425,85,Conti Zecca 2007 Donna Marzia Malvasia (Salento),"This is a pretty Malvasia with drying tones of pear, hay and honeysuckle layered over the wine's smooth, clean texture. It is a very food-friendly wine that would pair with first courses or appetizers.",Anonymous,
425,426,85,Finca Sophenia 2007 Altosur Malbec (Tupungato),"A bit of dust and leather for openers, with short black-fruit flavors and a big wave of tannins on the palate. So expect some grab and choppiness. Despite moderate hardness, there's good dark fruit and limited herbal intrusion.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
426,427,87,Montsarra NV Brut Sparkling (Cava),"More in the Champagne style, meaning the nose is yeasty and toasty, and the color is more gold than pale yellow. The palate offers wholesome apple, lemon and green herb flavors, and the finish is dry and peppery, with some bitterness. Strives for more complexity than most cavas, and it gets there for the most part.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
427,428,87,Talisman 2004 Wildcat Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is Steve MacRostie's vineyard, located in the far northwest of the appellation, practically in Sonoma Coast. Their '04 strikes me as a little heavy and obvious now, but that may be a function of its relative youth. The wine is dry and crisp, with jammy raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors. Could do interesting things in the next 3–5 years.",Anonymous,
428,429,87,Tangent 2006 Ecclestone White (Central Coast),"A blend of six varieties, but it's not a simple wine made from the leftovers that some wineries use for blends. Instead, it's crisp and fruity, not as dry as Tangent's varietal wines, but rich in Muscat orange, Riesling flowers, Pinot Gris citrus, Viognier tropical fruit and Pinot Blanc peach. One percent Albariño seems to add to the acidity.",Anonymous,

431,432,87,Col Vetoraz Spumanti NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),"Soapy lavender and floral tones are followed by loads of citrus fruit.

432,433,87,DFJ Vinhos 2005 Caladoc-Alicante Boushet Red (Estremadura),"A big, burly, juicy wine, focusing on powerful red fruits and layers of acidity. The tannins are dense, but the fruit is more dominant. There are smoky flavors, spiked with licorice and blueberries. Caladoc is a cross between Malbec and Grenache, developed in France, rarely planted.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
433,434,87,Drusian NV Brut  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),Here is a more opulent style of Prosecco with floral and mineral tones backed by an attractive herbal accent. The mouthfeel is creamy and thick so this expression will appeal less to those looking for zippy freshness.,Anonymous,
434,435,87,Frei Brothers 2005 Reserve Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"Shows off the reasons why Dry Creek has achieved a good reputation for this finicky variety, Merlot. The wine isn't made big, gooey Napa-style. Instead, there's an herbal earthiness to the cherry-berry fruit, and the dry tannins suggest pairing with rich fare.",Anonymous,
435,436,87,Torres 2006 Gran Viña Sol Chardonnay (Penedès),"The bouquet deals some peach, custard and a slight hint of oak, while the palate runs racy, fresh and citrusy.

436,437,87,Graham Beck 2005 Gamekeeper's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson),"Soft spice and blackberry on the nose are followed by rich, balanced layers of mint, toast and berry.

437,438,87,Jaillance 2004 Grande Tradition  (Clairette de Die),"Not too dissimilar from an Italian Moscato d'Asti, this offers exotic scents of oranges and tropical fruit. It's a bit sweet, but balanced in part by the bubbles. This would be great at brunch, or served on its own.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
438,439,87,Veraison 2003 Stagecoach Vineyard Synchrony Red (Napa Valley),"Kudos to the winery for holding back this Cab Franc, Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec blend until it's had time to turn gently soft and velvety.

439,440,87,J. Portugal Ramos 2003 Marquès de Borba Reserva Red (Alentejo),"The huge concentration of this wine reflects the hot 2003 vintage. There are aromas of ripe fruit skins, and flavors of big, juicy, hugely rich black fruits, with dark tannins and a hot texture.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
440,441,87,Kanonkop 2003 Paul Sauer Red (Stellenbosch),"Cigar, coffee and mocha on the nose, followed by smoke and tobacco on the palate, give this ageable wine a masculine, restrained edge.

441,442,87,Clos du Val 2004 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"The '04 is close to the '03 in quality, but falls off in structure, no doubt due to the hot vintage. It's a little too soft to balance the cola and cherry-pie filling flavors. Still, it's elegant.",Anonymous,
442,443,87,Graham Beck 2005 Brut Rosé  (Western Cape),"An appealing ripe strawberry nose leads on this flirty, easy-drinking sparkling wine from South Africa. Freshness and a touch of delicate minerality in the aromas, followed by light, elegant flavors of strawberry and yeast, make it a lovely wine for a summer day or to pair with myriad dishes.

444,445,93,Goat Bubbles 2011 Sierra Madre Vineyard Crémant Sparkling (Santa Maria Valley),"Vigorous bubbles present a Pinot Noir-like nose of crushed rocks, Indian spice and sour earth on one of the best Central Coast sparklers of the vintage.

445,446,93,La Chablisienne 2011 Blanchot Grand Cru  (Chablis),"Still tight and closed, this has the potential to be a very fine Grand Cru.

446,447,93,Louis Jadot 2012 Le Clos Blanc Beaune Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),"Part of the domaine of the Gagey family that runs Louis Jadot, this dense, wood-dominated wine has an austere character at this stage.

448,449,93,Olivier Leflaive 2012 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),"This is full of steely acidity as well as complex fruit.

Drink from 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
449,450,93,Pascal Bouchard 2012 Blanchot Grand Cru  (Chablis),"Smooth and wonderfully ripe, this honeyed wine has weight and a velvet texture that rolls around the mouth.

450,451,93,Vega Sicilia 2009 Valbuena 5°  (Ribera del Duero),"This is the best Valbuena since 2005, and it may be better than that.

452,453,92,Olivier Leflaive 2012 Sous le Dos d'Ane Premier Cru  (Meursault-Blagny),"While the wine appears initially generous, it then reveals a strongly steely, tight and mineral character.

Drink from 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
453,454,92,Poças 1992 Colheita  (Port),"It may be 22 years old, but this wine is still so young.

It's a beautiful wine that has been bottled at its peak, ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
454,455,92,Poças 1997 Colheita  (Port),"This wood-aged wine shows as much fruit as wood. It's complex and dense, with wonderful acidity and sweet raisin fruits that give richness. Acidity gives the wine a lift, but it's the aromas and silky texture that have the last word.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
455,456,92,Raúl Pérez 2010 Ultreia de Valtuille Mencía (Bierzo),"Upon opening, this smells oaky and lemony, although airing brings it around. Fresh and mildly astringent on the palate, this tastes oaky and briny at first, then more complex, deep and toasty as it spreads out. Licorice, herb and background berry flavors are woody and still somewhat fiery on the finish. Drink 2015 through 2025.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
456,457,92,Ruca Malen 2010 Kinien de Don Raúl Red (Mendoza),"Balsamic, dark-berry aromas come with notes of crushed minerals, coconut, resiny oak and chocolate.

459,460,92,Albert Morot 2012 Bressandes Premier Cru  (Beaune),"This firm, dark and still young wine has intense acidity that comes from the red currant and raspberry fruit.

Every element is in perfect proportion.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
468,469,92,Lange 2012 Yamhill-Carlton Assemblage Pinot Noir,"Carefully distinguished from the other Lange Pinots, this cuvée marries thick cherry fruit to highlights of cola, anise and earth.

469,470,92,Le Cadeau 2012 Équinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Especially rich and complex in this outstanding vintage, this brings bright and deeply flavored cherry fruit front and center.

592,593,89,Fritsch 2013 Schlossberg Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),"A subtle nose of citrus suggests a restrained wine.

594,595,89,Gorman 2012 Zachary's Ladder Red (Red Mountain),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Syrah (32%) and Petit Verdot offers notes of blueberries and high-toned herbs that don't entirely seem to marry. Flavors are rich and concentrated with a supple feel.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
595,596,89,San Pedro 2010 1865 Single Vineyard Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Spicy plum and cherry aromas are oaky and smell a bit like freshly laid cement.

Lightly herbal flavors of currant and plum are spicy and finish with oak-driven notes of toast as well as green olive and pointed acidity. Drink through 2017.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
596,597,89,Standing Stone 2013 Ice Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Lavish floral notes perfume this lusciously sweet ice-style Riesling. Honeyed apples and fresh figs burst on the palate, their flavors intensified on the finish with a hit of zesty lemon acidity.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
597,598,88,Gloria Ferrer NV Va de Vi Iltra Cuvée Sparkling (Sonoma County),"This is basically the same as Gloria's brut, only they added some Muscat and made it a little sweeter.

628,629,85,Tinhorn Creek 2012 Oldfield Series Merlot (Okanagan Valley),"Though it's designated as reserve-level, and lists rather high alcohol, this seems thin, stemmy and green.

630,631,85,Les Useres 2013 L'Alcalatén Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castelló),"Floral, soapy aromas of tomato, cherry and currant are light and lack commitment.

714,715,85,Domaine du Haut Bourg 2013 Pavillon Sur Lie  (Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu),"The wine is fruity while still being closed up and tight. That allows for hints of the apple flavors to come through while still retaining a nervy, steely character. Drink from 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
715,716,85,Viña Bisquertt 2014 La Joya Gran Reserva Gewürztraminer (Colchagua Valley),"Tropical fruit and white-flower aromas are foxy and strained.

718,719,85,Saget la Perrière 2014 La Petite Perrière Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),"This is a gentle style of Sauvignon Blanc that has just a touch of herbaceousness to go with the fresh, young grapefruit and crisp apple flavors. It's a wine to drink this summer.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
719,720,85,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2012 Montes Claros Reserva Red (Alentejo),"This is a tough wine, filled with tannins and missing out on the fruit.

721,722,85,Bailiwick 2012 Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Light and ethereal in color, this vineyard-designated wine has a thinness.

724,725,85,Caves Velhas 2013 Serradayres Red (Tejo),"Too much wood aging gives this wine a burnt, dry character. Beneath this almost-bitter texture lie hints of ripe red fruits and acidity. Wait until 2016 and the wine may become more fruity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
725,726,85,Deering 2011 Maus Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Juicy in a slightly overripe way, this sweet, plummy and jammy wine is soft and supple in broad tannins. On the finish, a combination of smoke and vanilla make their point.",Virginie Boone,@vboone

729,730,85,Alto Los Romeros 2012 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Smoky, cooked berry aromas lead to a full, flabby, rubbery-feeling palate with baked black-fruit flavors that suggest baking spices.

730,731,85,Bodegas Langa 2012 Pi Garnacha Blanca (Spain),"Floral white-flower aromas settle on buttercup and lees notes, while in the mouth this is creamy but low on structure. Yeasty peach and apple flavors finish chunky, and overall low acidity is an issue.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
731,732,92,Bergström 2011 Bergström Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The best of the 2011 Pinots from Bergström, this firm and balanced wine is based upon a solid core of raspberry and cherry fruit.

733,734,92,Communication Block 2011 Lampyridae Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine shows the intensity of fruit that Mount Veeder is capable of expressing.

735,736,92,Marimar Estate 2010 Don Miguel Vineyard Estate Grown & Bottled Unfiltered Syrah-Tempranillo (Russian River Valley),"Tempranillo brings its signature delicacy, acidity and cherry fruit.

736,737,92,Ottella 2011 Molceo  (Lugana Superiore),"Yellow peach, pear, mineral, Alpine herbs and almond jump out of the glass.

740,741,92,Dr. Hermann 2012 Erdener Treppchen Herzlay Spätlese Goldkap Riesling (Mosel),"Earthy aromas at the outset subside to reveal bright tangerine, honey and saffron notes on this intensely fruity, medium-sweet wine.

742,743,92,Amapola Creek 2009 Estate Bottled Unfined & Unfiltered Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"There's a great wine lurking inside big, hard tannins, but it's going to take some time to express itself.

744,745,92,Burgess 2010 Estate Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The grapes come from the winery's estate vineyards on Howell Mountain, and you can sense the mountain intensity, both of tannins and fruity concentration.

762,763,83,Borsao 2014 Tres Picos Garnacha (Campo de Borja),"A blast of burnt wood and sawmill is the greeting on this heavily oaked Garnacha. Specific aromas of wood shavings, creosote and Bourbon barrel amount to a sundae's worth of oak notes. Flavors of char, coffee, chocolate and burnt wood dominate this overly oaked wine that is weak on core fruit.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
763,764,83,Ébano 2014 6  (Ribera del Duero),"Barnyard aromas atop berry scents make for a nose that's not entirely clean. A clipped, tough palate has hard tannins and short berry flavors. A finish with heat and bitterness makes this a tough go.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
764,765,83,Ghost Pines 2014 Winemaker's Blend Chardonnay (Monterey County-Napa County-Sonoma County),"The majority of the grapes for this wine hail from Monterey County, with a large portion also coming from Napa County. The remaining 19% are from Sonoma County. In all, the wine is a tad simple and generic, not offering much in the way of aroma or flavor.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
765,766,89,Osprey's Dominion 2012 Fumé Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"There's a hint of smoke that adds a dark edge to the pretty white floral notes of this easy drinking, elegantly balanced Sauvignon Blanc. It's dry and refreshing on the palate, while hints of waxy minerality and bitter lime pith lend complexity to the finish.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
766,767,89,Quinta de São Sebastião 2009 Reserva Red (Lisboa),"A powerful, tannic wine, very dry and firm. Underneath the dry exterior, there are great fruits waiting to fully express themselves. It will always be a structured wine, the black fruits a serious component along with the spice from wood aging. Keep for 4–5 more years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
767,768,89,Quinta do Portal 2008 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),"With its stumpy, old fashioned bottle and cork, this is an LBV for aging. It is perfumed and smooth, with a core of solid tannins and a firm texture. Black fruits and just the right amount of sweetness balance the dryness of the spirit. Keep for several years, or drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
768,769,89,Ronco Calino NV Brut Satèn Sparkling (Franciacorta),"Elegant and creamy, with pretty highlights of peach, melon and toasted bread, this beautiful Italian sparkler makes a perfect opener for a long and sophisticated meal. Foamy effervescence gives the wine depth and persistency.",Anonymous,
769,770,89,Chiarello Family Vineyards 2010 Felicia Zinfandel (St. Helena),"This is a high-alcohol Zin; it almost tastes like Port, with rich raisin, chocolate, blackberry and nettle flavors. It's admirable for sheer power, but will go to your head after a glass or two.",Anonymous,
770,771,89,Coastview 2009 Red Wine Red (Monterey County),"This Bordeaux-style blend is nothing like anything from Napa Valley. It's more acidic and tighter, with rustically old-fashioned tannins. Yet the blackberry, cherry, plum and raisin flavors are thoroughly modern. Pleasant now, and should hold for a few years.",Anonymous,
771,772,89,Georges Duboeuf 2011 Oak-Aged  (Moulin-à-Vent),"A step up from Sélection in the Moulin-à-Vent range from Duboeuf, this wine has been aged in oak for six months. The result is a ripe, smoothly textured wine, its cherry fruits offering an attractive smoky character. It could do with a year, even two, for aging.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
772,773,89,Kasuari 2010 Parady Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A big Cabernet, showing the dramatic mouthfeel that well-made Napa Cabernet always has.

773,774,89,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2010 Les Gourmandes  (Chorey-lès-Beaune),"Chorey-lès-Beaune, on the plain just north of Beaune, can offer—as here—good value for Burgundy. This wine, still showing some young austerity, has the potential to develop into a bold, fruity selection that will always have a firmer structured edge.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
774,775,89,La Tosa 2011 Vignamorello  (Gutturnio Classico Superiore),"This blend of Barbera and Bonarda opens with an inky dark appearance and offers fresh aromas of plump cherry fruit, cola and cherry liqueur. The wine is thick, dense and slightly sweet with an almost syrupy finish.",Anonymous,
775,776,89,Miro 2011 Floodgate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This delicious Pinot Noir is Miro's best ever. It's ripe in fruit and spices, offering wave after wave of raspberry Newton, brown sugar, Dr. Pepper cola, cinnamon and sandalwood flavors that persist through a long finish. Easy to like now, but it's not an ager.",Anonymous,
776,777,89,Quinta do Portal NV Ten Year Old Aged Tawny  (Port),"A classic 10-year old tawny, hovering tantalizingly between wood-aged flavors and fruit. It comes down just on the side of the wood flavors, suggesting the blend has some older wines in it. It is a deliciously drinkable, not too dry, wine.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
777,778,89,Ridge 2011 Estate Monte Bello Vineyards Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Rich, ripe and flashy, with honey, pineapple and orange jam and toasty oak flavors. It's brightened with crisp acidity. With some heat from alcohol, it's deliciously approachable now.",Anonymous,

779,780,89,Sineann 2012 Wy'East Vineyard Pinot Gris (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"An aromatically distinctive wine, with notes of peanut shells, dried apricot, and lees. A hair off dry, it's broad and textured, with vibrant acidity, finishing just a touch bitter.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
780,781,89,François Lurton 2011 Gran Lurton Corte Friulano White (Mendoza),"This yellow-tinted blend of Friulano, Chardonnay, Viognier and Pinot Gris is classy and smoky on the nose, with no shortage of toasty oak. Core apple, melon and citrus flavors are rich and smooth, while this finishes round and full in body. Corte Friulano is really good for an oddball Argentine white blend.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
781,782,89,Georges Duboeuf 2011 Emile Beranger  (Pouilly-Fuissé),This is a fresh wine that also has a strong sense of structure. It's textured with white fruits coming through a nervy acidity and minerality. Hints of wood are tantalizing and round the wine out at the end.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
782,783,89,Vista Hills 2010 Piedmont Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A distinctive streak of cola runs through this wine, along with a mix of wild strawberries and spice. It's elegant and seamless, doing a lovely, gentle fade into a lightly spicy finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
783,784,89,O. Fournier 2010 Alfa Crux Sauvignon Blanc (Uco Valley),"With feline aromas of juniper bush, grass and sweaty citrus, this is true Sauvignon Blanc. Oak aging has lent an easiness to the mouthfeel, which shows good acidity. Flavors of green fruits, melon and pithy bitterness end in chalky clarity. This is one of Argentina's best Sauvignon Blancs.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
784,785,89,Paco Garcia 2008 Beautiful Things  (Rioja),"Earthy, oaky, leathery berry and spice aromas come around nicely with airing. This is a plump Rioja with modern leanings; it has good structure and pretty raspberry and cassis flavors. A round finish hints at raisiny maturity but doesn't overdo the ripeness. Drink through 2015.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
785,786,89,Sonoma-Cutrer 2010 Owsley Vineyard Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Sonoma-Cutrer's Pinots have been disappointing in the past, but this release is a huge improvement. It's dry, silky in the mouth, and complex in flavors, offering hints of sour-cherry candy, red licorice, prosciutto, cola and sweet, smoky sandalwood. Best enjoyed now for its richness.",Anonymous,
786,787,89,Ampelos 2009 Gamma Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"This Syrah is inky black in color. It explodes on the palate with black currants, herbs and black pepper, with a distinct note of animal and char, like a roasted bone. There's some real complexity, as well as deliberate restraint. Good to drink now, with proper decanting, and could develop interestingly over the next 4–5 years.",Anonymous,
787,788,91,Château la Coste 2010 Les Pentes Douces Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"The wine has considerable acidity that comes from the balance of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon in the wine.

788,789,91,Dirler-Cadé 2008 Belzbrunnen Riesling (Alsace),"The wannabe Grand Cru of Belzbrunnen has produced this marvellously mature wine. It's fully ripe and shows its perfumed flavors strongly. The acidity is still very present, giving a tight presence to this impressive wine.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
789,790,91,Domaine Albert Mann 2011 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"This is a very mineral and structured wine.

Drink from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
790,791,91,Domaine Charles Baur 2011 Cuvée Charles Riesling (Alsace),"An aromatic wine with great depth, this is complex and concentrated.

791,792,91,Efeste 2010 Ceidleigh Syrah (Red Mountain),"Pronounced Kay-lee, this is sourced from Red Mountain, hence the graphite and grain in the tannins. Lush cherry, tobacco and earth flavors combine, with a whiff of smoke wafting through the wine from start to finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
792,793,91,Efeste 2010 Jolie Bouche Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"The Jolie Bouche is dark and brambly, packed with blackberry fruit, baking spices and a dusting of black pepper. The supple tannins carry a streak of graphite and clean earth.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

795,796,91,Hatzimichalis 2008 Kapnias Vineyard Zygos Cabernet Sauvignon (Atalanti Valley),"Aromas of red fruit, vanilla and cigarbox start this Cabernet Sauvignon from Greece.

796,797,91,Nittnaus Hans und Christine 2011 Nit'ana Red (Burgenland),"Warm, cinnamon-spiced blueberry and plum flood the palate, while approachable and supple tannins charm their way from start to long finish. This has wonderful balance of structure, fruit and medium-full body. This has huge charm right now and is very seductive, but it will also age well, if you can wait.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
797,798,91,R&A; Pfaffl 2011 Altenberg Reserve St. Laurent (Niederösterreich),"There is something subliminally medicinal about these aromas—the ethereal lift of herbal tinctures alloyed with dark plum and a generous dash of white pepper. This is not for beginners looking for easy fruit notes, but rather for those who like to converse with their wine. This layered, compelling and balanced glassful will provide food for thought with its finely structured tannins, medium body and bundles of flavor.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
798,799,91,Silverado 2010 Mt. George Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This Cabernet is a guaranteed cellar candidate.

799,800,91,Southard 2011 White Wine White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Scott Southard has flipped the percentages from the 2010 vintage, placing Roussanne in the driver's seat, and Viognier holding up one third of the blend.

800,801,91,Umani Ronchi 2012 Casal di Serra  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore),"Notes of hawthorne, acacia and tropical fruit open this quintessential expression of Verdicchio. The fresh, juicy palate is loaded with pineapple, creamy white peach and lemon custard flavors, accented by hints of balsamic herbs and ocean-like salinity. Energizing mineral adds to the depth. Hold for 2–3 years to develop complexity or enjoy now for the fruit purity.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
801,802,91,Iby 2011 Chevalier Blaufränkisch (Mittelburgenland),"If you expect coquettish flirting you must go elsewhere: this amply layered red will not give up its secrets easily.

806,807,91,Black Kite 2011 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The new oak on this Pinot Noir dominates now with aromas and flavors of buttered toast and caramel.

807,808,91,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg 2011 Furstentum Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Although the sweetness is not indicated on the label, this is a medium-dry wine, edging towards the sweeter end.

817,818,92,Seghesio 2008 Old Vine Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Extraordinarily rich and complicated in flavors, this wine comes from vineyards that are at least 50 years old.

820,821,92,Louis Jadot 2007 Les Suchots Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),"Very smoky aromas, the fruit ripe with sweet blackberry flavors.

826,827,92,Evening Land 2008 Occidental Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tough to appreciate now due to its acidity and tannins, which lock it down behind a cloak of impenetrability. There are exotic wild raspberry and cherry fruit, cola, licorice, Provençal herb, bacon and pepper flavors, but you can't quite get to them, because they're behind bars. Obviously needs time.

The nose is full of mineral, graphite, coconut and heavenly black fruit, while the palate is bright, pure and delicious as it leans toward black-currant liqueur, blackberry and boysenberry.

953,954,83,Budeguer 2009 Patrimonio Seleccion de Barricas Malbec (Mendoza),"This is overripe and raisiny, no two ways about it.

958,959,83,Michel Torino 2014 Cuma Made With Organic Grapes Malbec (Cafayate),"Rustic tomato and cherry aromas make for a scratchy opening.

959,960,83,Mont Paral NV Reserva Selection Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Leesy aromas of tropical fruits feed into a flat palate. Leesy but bland peach and melon flavors lack conviction and finish sketchy, with nothing in particular standing out. This is the definition of a marginal Cava.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

971,972,89,Upland Estates 2008 Old Vine Cabernet Sauvignon (Snipes Mountain),"If you are looking for elegant, moderate (13.7%) alcohol and old vine Cabernet flavors, here is your wine. Astringent tannins and lightly herbal, earthy undertones set the stage for the complex midpalate.

972,973,89,Villa Maria 2010 Cellar Selection Dry Riesling (Marlborough),"At 7.5 g/L of residual sugar, this is more off-dry than dry, but the acidity is high enough to provide a sense of crispness.

982,983,87,Ledson 2008 Caudalies Reserve Red (Sonoma Valley),"Made from equal parts Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, this blend seems to detract from the purity of both.

983,984,87,Walter Dacon 2008 C'est Syrah Magnifique Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Finished in French oak, the Magnifique bottling from Walter Dacon seems a bit plain, almost generic in this vintage. Red fruit, noticeably high alcohol (14.8%) that you can taste, and tongue-scraping astringency suggest that this may need significantly more bottle age to pull itself together.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
984,985,87,Williams Selyem 2009 Forchini Vineyard North Flats Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Quite a good Zinfandel, although it does show some of the weaknesses that strike this vineyard in a cool year.

993,994,87,Castro Pena Alba 2008 Serrado Colheita Red (Dão),"A wine that rides between the richness of its black fruits and the tight acidity that gives it considerable juiciness. The result is a wine that is fruity, with layers of coffee and vanilla, likely to benefit from two more years' aging.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
994,995,87,Cerro Prieto 2008 Paso Bordo Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This ripe, rich wine can't quite get around its alcohol level, which is 15.8%.

1021,1022,88,Casa de la Ermita 2013 Crianza Red (Jumilla),"Floral berry and plum aromas are lightly woody. This feels full and edgy, with fairly hard tannins. Black-fruit flavors are certainly ripe, while this finishes bold and intense, with scratchy tannins. The blend is Monastrell, Tempranillo and Cab Sauvignon.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1022,1023,88,Dezzani 2012 San Carlo  (Barolo),"This opens with subdued aromas of dark berry, cake spice, espresso and a whiff of pressed violet. On the straightforward palate, hints of white pepper and star anise add depth to dried morello cherry while solid tannins lend support.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
1023,1024,88,Vins El Cep 2011 Claror Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),"Briny apple and nectarine aromas are within the proper framework of brut nature. Citric and stone-fruit acidity makes for a racy palate, while this tastes mostly of peach and nectarine along with some salt and brine. A firm finish is acidic and dry.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1024,1025,88,McFadden 2015 Blue Quail Pinot Gris (Potter Valley),"A tangy feeling on the palate makes this light-bodied wine especially refreshing. It has appley, floral aromas and flavors, good acidity and a clean, bracing texture.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
1025,1026,88,Vionta 2006 Estate Bottled Single Vineyard Limited Release Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Vionta aims for the racy, lively style of Albariño, and for the most part it nails it. Aromas of peach and nectarine are youthful and pure, while the flavors of apple, peach and lime are pleasant. Not over the top but instead it achieves balance and ease. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1026,1027,88,Juslyn Vineyards 2003 Perry's Blend Red (Napa Valley),"A very good wine, rich and packed with flavor. A dry and softly tannic, it floods the mouth with cassis, red currant, blueberry, plum, cocoa and smoky oak flavors.",Anonymous,
1027,1028,88,Valdo NV Brut Cuvée del Fondatore  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),"This has huge floral tendencies with fragrant notes of jasmine and honeysuckle. Sweet peach, tea leaf and chopped herbs also make an appearance and the wine boasts a lean, spicy finish.",Anonymous,
1028,1029,88,Valdo NV Brut Cuvée di Boj  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),"This is a tonic, almost crunchy, Prosecco with spicy effervescence and lingering notes of candied lemon drops, lavender and honey. Its overall intensity is high without being pungent and there are loads of peach-like flavors over the crisp finish.",Anonymous,
1029,1030,88,Zanetti NV Case Bianche Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),"This Prosecco stands out in a crowd thanks to its strong concentration of pear-like aromas. That pear note is embellished by similar tones of Golden Delicious apple, almond and melon. Great personality and persistency in the mouth.",Anonymous,
1030,1031,88,Zardetto NV Brut Prosecco (Italy),"Here's another terrific no-fuss Italian sparkler with a tight, tonic mouthfeel. There's nice linearity and coherency to the aromas that recall stone fruit and lemon drop.",Anonymous,
1031,1032,88,Sumarroca 2005 Brut Nature Gran Reserva Cava Sparkling (Penedès),"Dry, pure and attractive on the nose, with crisp apple and lemon-lime flavors. This wine performs on an even keel from start to finish, and it's dry, tangy and correct as far as brut nature cavas go. Verges on elegant.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1032,1033,88,Domaine Alfred 2005 Califa Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Represents a big improvement over last year's Califa; this one returns to dryness thanks to the cool vintage. Edna Valley acidity brightens cherry, root beer, vanilla bean and oak flavors. Dry and complex now, the wine should peak in a year or so, then hold through 2010.",Anonymous,
1033,1034,88,Clos du Val 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This big Chardonnay, which was entirely barrel fermented, is tasting a bit too oaky. It was sourced from the winery's estate Carneros vineyard and shows that appellation's crisp acids, along with bright tropical fruit and spice flavors. But the sweet, charry vanilla and caramel from barrels tends to dominate.",Anonymous,
1034,1035,88,Mas de Monistrol NV MPX Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Pretty pear, apple and other dusty white-fruit aromas start this cleansing cava on its way to pure citrus, Granny Smith apple and lime flavors. It has a mildly linear, angular feel but it doesn't come across sheer or sour; to the contrary, it's balanced and generous with its fruit.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1035,1036,88,Astoria 2006 Casa Vittorino 20 Anni Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),"The nose here is deeply redolent of fresh fruit with distinct tones of peach, apricot, citrus, Granny Smith apple and pear.

When it is young, as here, the fresh, crisp Alvarinho dominates, giving lively, vibrant green-fruit flavors. Some weight underneath hints at the Chardonnay.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

Lohr 2005 Arroyo Seco Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Barrel-fermented and aged on the lees, this Burgundian-style Chard is creamy and rich in ripe tropical fruit flavors and new oak. It's a big wine, forward in pineapple and mango flavors that are honey-ripe and crisp.",Anonymous,
1040,1041,88,Smith & Hook 2005 Grand Reserve Red (Central Coast),"Smith & Hook has tried hard to perfect their Cab, transferring fruit sourcing from Monterey to Paso Robles. As a result, the wines are riper, as evidenced by this fruity young Cab. The cherry and blackberry flavors are balanced by firm tannins and crisp acids, making it a versatile wine at the table.",Anonymous,
1041,1042,88,Talisman 2004 Thorn Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The vineyard is in a cool area of this sprawling appellation southwest of Sebastopol, but the heat of the vintage shows in the wine's relative softness and ripeness of fruit. The cherries, raspberries and dates are almost, but not quite, cooked, bringing to mind a Fig Newton cookie. Scores high on the deliciousness scale, but it's not a wine for the cellar. Drink now.",Anonymous,
1042,1043,88,Luca 2006 Laborde Double Select Syrah (Uco Valley),"Controlled berry and plum aromas are pure and not mucked up by too much oak. Like all Luca wines, this Syrah is bulky, full-framed and meaty. It's extracted but well balanced, with mellow fruit and a dark, crusty finish. Very pleasant and chunky, but not overwhelming. Drink now or over the next year or two.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1043,1044,88,Mesa 2006 Opale  (Vermentino di Sardegna),"Packaged in an elegant but very heavy bottle, this Vermentino from Sardinia offers fruity aromas of peach and nectarine backed by good length and consistency. Pair this refreshing wine with shellfish or spaghetti con vongole.",Anonymous,
1044,1045,88,Naia 2006 Naiades Verdejo (Rueda),"Definitely a particular wine, meaning it's fully oaked and probably not for everyone. But if you don't mind full-out barrel notes on your citrusy Verdejo, then you should like it. There's honey, toast, popcorn, pepper and vanilla aromas and flavors, all courtesy of barrel fermentation. It's also smooth and clean, with good core acidity and balance. Nice wine; not Burgundy; not for all palates.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1045,1046,88,Naia 2007 Las Brisas White (Rueda),"In cooler vintages like 2007, this white blend from Bodegas Naia excels. It gets going with pear, apple and light, leesy aromas in front of a citrusy palate that is a knock-off for varietal Sauvignon Blanc. Flavors of grapefruit, lime and gooseberry should be familiar, and the crisp fresh-lettuce finish is a winner. Good stuff for the money.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1046,1047,88,R.L. Buller & Son 2004 Calliope Limited Release Durif (Rutherglen),"Despite substantial alcohol (16.5%), this admirably concentrated wine doesn't show that much heat, nor does it show any roasted, cooked character. Instead, it delivers black olive, leather and cassis flavors just tinged with mint and a fresh, lively finish hinting at coffee. The tannins are soft but present, helping to balance a hint of residual sugar. Drink now–2012.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
1047,1048,88,Sandeman NV 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),"This has a fine bite, offering its richness on the edge of a knife. Wood and fruit tannins are very evident, giving the concentration a dry, fresh core, over which dried fruit flavors pass. It has some age to it, as if there are older wines in the blend.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1048,1049,88,Tarapaca 2005 Zavala Red (Maipo Valley),"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with 7% Syrah and 6% Merlot, this presents wonderfully pure, expressive notes of mint, cassis and vanilla. It just lacks that extra touch of textural richness to put it in the top category. A prebottling sample of the 2007 was more impressive.",Anonymous,
1049,1050,88,Tarapaca 2008 La Isla Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Tomato leaf and nettle aromas join with grapefruit and tropical fruit. This is both more pungent and rounder than the Reserva, with greater concentration and verve.",Anonymous,
1050,1051,88,Trivento 2006 Golden Reserve Syrah (Mendoza),"A big, woody, totally modern style of Syrah. There is a lot more coconut, mocha and big berry fruit than anything you might find from France. It's dark and layered on the palate, with coconut and resin supporting black fruit. Finishes smoky and oaky, but structured, tannic and serious enough to impress.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1051,1052,88,Valori 2003 Vigna Sant'Angelo  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"This wine has beautiful complexity and balance backed by a soft, generous personality. Oak aging has shaped tones of spice, chocolate and vanilla with a smooth, rich texture that lasts long on the palate. Hedonistic and opulent.",Anonymous,
1052,1053,88,W.H. Smith 2006 Piedra Hill Vineyard Bronze Label Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"A very nice, elegant and complex Cab, showing firm mountain tannins that give a somewhat dry astringency to the rather sweet cherry, blackberry, mocha and cedar flavors. Its future is hard to predict. Now through 2010.",Anonymous,
1053,1054,88,El Coto 2000 Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Like you might expect from a maturing gran reserva, Imaz offers glimpses of raisin, sweet berry and even some aged cheese. In the mouth, it's all about red fruit, although an earthy undertone provides some background. Feels a little stark, zesty and lean, while the finish is solid and tastes of vanilla and leather. Drink now through 2012.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1054,1055,87,Arnaldo Caprai 2006 Grecante Grechetto (Colli Martani),"Caprai's luminous Grechetto from central Italy is full-bodied and opulent and offers layers of honey, stone fruit, yellow rose and vanilla cream. The wine has power and persistency thanks to its natural density and richness.",Anonymous,
1055,1056,87,Baglio di Pianetto 2004 Ramione Red (Sicilia),"Ramione is a 50-50 blend of Merlot and Nero d'Avola that delivers a unique and very attractive mineral quality. Under that drying layer of white stone and talc powder, you'll find bursting red cherry and rich blueberry. The various elements of this velvety wine work very well together.",Anonymous,
1056,1057,87,Capel Vale 2005 Regional Series Shiraz (Mount Barker),"Mixed berry, cola and cedar notes dominate the nose, while the palate is packed with cherry cola and leather flavors. The dense texture could use some time to open up, and that suggestion of ageability is reinforced by the finish's dry, dusty tannins. Drink 2010–15. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.",Anonymous,
1057,1058,87,Château Julien 2006 Black Nova Red (Monterey County),"A blend of Zinfandel and Syrah, this wine is softly rich and jammy, with very ripe, forward black and red currant, chocolate, licorice and black pepper flavors. Fundamentally dry, though it leaves behind the impression of glyceriney sweetness.",Anonymous,
1058,1059,87,Clos La Chance 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"Extraordinarily ripe, this Cab erupts with pie-filling blackberry, cherry, currant and chocolate flavors. It's not exactly sweet, but seems so, especially with the caramelized oak coating. Drink now with a grilled steak.",Anonymous,
1059,1060,87,Domaine des Corbillières 2007 Sauvignon Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine),"Classic, intensely herbaceous and grassy, this is fine cool-climate Sauvignon Blanc. It keeps some restraint as the fresh grapefruit flavors soften out midpalate. The final flavor, though, is full-on asparagus and green fruits.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1060,1061,87,Finca El Origen 2007 Reserva Torrontés (Cafayate),"The best wine in the El Origen portfolio is this Torrontés from northerly Cafayate. It's true to the blueprint, showing fresh lychee, honeydew and acacia aromas, which are followed by lemon-lime flavors, green-herb notes and a touch of citrus pith.

1061,1062,87,Fog Alley 2007 Unoaked Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Tastes like it comes from Edna Valley, with its dryness, great burst of juicy acidity and jammy Mandarin orange, lime, kiwi and Meyer lemon flavors. Great with crab cakes dressed in a mango salsa.",Anonymous,
1062,1063,87,Umani Ronchi 2005 Jorio  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"The wine's cherry and spice flavors reach a good balance and create a solid wall of taste and flavor.

1063,1064,83,Finca La Luz 2013 Callejon del Crimen Estate Malbec (Uco Valley),"Candied red-fruit aromas are thin and limited. This is edgy, rubbery and tannic in feel, with rudimentary raspberry and red-plum flavors. A juicy finish is lean and tastes medicinal.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1064,1065,83,Burnt Bridge 2012 Upland Vineyards Grenache (Snipes Mountain),"Aromatically unusual, this suggests raspberry jam, purple flowers, orange peel and manure. Flavors are tangy and almost seem to have a light spritz.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport

1067,1068,83,Avelina 2012 Ringer White (North Coast),"With very neutral aromas and flavors, this medium-bodied and reasonably crisp wine will be fine for everyday meals. Made from 60% Chardonnay and 40% Viognier, it is quiet and subdued. .",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars

1069,1070,83,Diseño 2012 Old Vine Malbec (Mendoza),"Stalky aromas make for a sketchy opening. In the mouth, this is blocky and grabby in feel. Burnt, underripe flavors of berry fruits are herbal and finish with grassy notes.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1070,1071,83,Lágrimas de Maria 2009 Reserva  (Rioja),"Dense, roasted, earthy aromas start with tomato and fall off to raisiny and overripe.

1071,1072,82,Larchago 2009 Reserva  (Rioja),"Oaky aromas of maple and molasses are overriding and ponderous. In the mouth, this is tannic and punishing.

1077,1078,82,Bodegas Paniza 2013 Agostón Garnacha-Syrah (Cariñena),"Syrupy red-berry and cherry aromas are medicinal, while the mouthfeel on this blend is hard and abrasive.

1132,1133,90,K Vintners 2009 Stoneridge Vineyard Merlot (Washington),"This is a very firm, tight and focused effort, with a clean cherry flavor. It is not at all like most Washington Merlots, which are often heavily influenced by new oak aging. Here is a concise, pure expression that may come across as a little monochromatic, perhaps because it seems to be somewhat shut down at the moment. Made using grapes from 10-year-old vines, it shows great promise.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

It's light to medium bodied.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
1148,1149,86,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2016 San de Guilhem Kaléidoscope White,"It's no wonder this wine is called Kaleidoscope: a blend of Viognier, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Muscat, it's unique and multifaceted. The varieties have come together very satisfactorily, giving perfumed and plenty of ripe fruitiness. With its touches of lychee, apricot and spice and crisp, tight acidity, it's ready to drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

1150,1151,86,Miolo 2012 Millésime Brut  (Vale dos Vinhedos),"Briny grassy aromas of apple and citrus are yeasty as well. This Chardonnay-Pinot Noir blend is foamy and active, while flavors run towards slightly bitter and yeasty, with fruit hard to find. A similar finish renders this good but with issues.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1151,1152,86,Salton NV Intenso Brut Sparkling (Serra Gaúcha),"A light color and tropical aromas of lime and lychee set up a full but flaccid palate. Yeasty bready flavors are less than fruity, while this tastes similar on a low-acid finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1152,1153,86,Adega Vila Real 2014 Reserva Red (Douro),"The oak aging gives this wine an attractive, spicy character. A blend of four of the Douro's most familiar varieties, it is rich, full of black fruit with a rich core of tannin and balanced acidity. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

1155,1156,86,Bodegas Carrau 2011 Amat Cerro Chapeu Tannat (Uruguay),"At first, this Tannat smells chalky and minerally; later it's leafy and a touch soapy in aromas. A fierce angular palate delivers tart black-plum flavors with tea notes. The finish is linear and long due to hard-driving acidity.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1156,1157,86,Casa Perini 2012 Quatro Red (Vale Trentino),"A sniff of this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tannat and Ancellotta is like a walk through the sawmill. Given how oaky this smells, it's no surprise that the palate is resiny in feel, with dry woody plum flavors. Additional oak dominates the finish on this one-dimensional barrel blaster.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1157,1158,86,Casanel 2015 Patricia Marie Pinot Gris (Middleburg),"This wine starts off on notes of lemons, almond skins and mushrooms. The palate is quite different with lots of green flavors, from grassiness, to green apple and celery stalks. This is simple in body and has a long nutty finish.",Carrie Dykes,
1158,1159,96,Andrew Will 2007 Sorella Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"In this new vintage of Sorella, Cabernet Sauvignon is again right out front at 72% of the blend. Here the fruit seems more subdued, the wine tight, the dense tannins showing graphite and mineral more than new barrel flavors. It definitely needs decanting.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1159,1160,96,Ojai 2007 Clos Pepe Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Huge, rich, white Burgundy style Chardonnay. Has a pie-filling fruity richness of pineapples, lemondrop, pears, kiwi fruit and exotic kumquats, balanced with fine, minerally acidity, and wrapped into a buttercream texture. The oak is flamboyant, but perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dazzling and dramatic, from a vineyard that just keeps performing better and better.",Anonymous,
1160,1161,96,Andrew Will 2007 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"A completely different blend from the winery's 2006 Ciel, this reflects Chris Camarda's growing enchantment with Cabernet Franc, which is now 45% of the blend. Most of the rest is Merlot—a Right Bank style. The concept works. It captures the sleek minerality of the site, and puts the fruit into tight, laser-like focus. The wine seems almost crystalline—sharp-edged and reflective, with penetrating angles and offset flavors.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1161,1162,95,Williams Selyem 2008 Allen Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.",Anonymous,
1162,1163,95,Le Chiuse 2004 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Le Chiuse has produced one of Montalcino's brightest stars with this Riserva 2004 (the base 2004 Brunello didn't impress us as nearly much). This is a delicious wine that you will enjoy on every level. The intensity and purity of the fruit and spice aromas are impressive and the mouthfeel is extra-plush and supple. Yet, those firm tannins give it the balance and structure it needs.",Anonymous,
1163,1164,95,Tantara 2007 Talley Rincon Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Massively rich, with pronounced, sweet, smoky oak flavors and a rich vein of tart, creamy lees highlighting the underlying fruity ripeness. Shows flavors of grilled pineapples, tropical mangoes and pears, balanced with crisp acids. Tremendously delicious and compelling.",Anonymous,
1164,1165,95,Andrew Will 2007 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality. Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1165,1166,95,Au Bon Climat 2007 Los Alamos Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",Anonymous,
1166,1167,95,Fort Ross 2007 Fort Ross Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"What a beautiful Pinot Noir for drinking now with lamb chops or maybe a rich, exotic Ahi tuna tartare. Brilliantly crisp in acidity, with a clean, bracing mouthfeel, it offers dazzlingly rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, orange zest, Dr. Pepper cola and Asian spices, with smoky oak adding elaborate tiers of vanilla char. For the price, it's a very great buy.",Anonymous,
1167,1168,95,Buty 2007 Rediviva of the Stones Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Violets and compost dance through the aromas, leading into an intensely fruity palate loaded with sappy berry richness, nuanced with scents and streaks of cured meat, garrigue, earth and graphite. Blending 77% Syrah with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, it strikes a perfect balance among fruit, earth, and rock. At its core it is still wrapped tight, immaculately clean, and still almost impenetrably dense.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1168,1169,94,Tantara 2008 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Superrich, ripe and flamboyant, if not particularly subtle. Dazzles for its tsunami of grilled pineapple custard, pear tart, golden mango and Key lime pie richness, accented with sweetly, caramelized oak, and brightened with brisk acidity. A racy, decadent crowd pleaser.",Anonymous,
1169,1170,94,Henri Bourgeois 2008 Le M.D. de Bourgeois  (Sancerre),"The initials refer to the vineyard of Mont Damné, the steepest vineyard in Sancerre. The wine reflects the stony character of the soil, coming through with great intensity. It is powerful, flinty, with a biting citrus character, deliciously taut and intense.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1170,1171,94,Vineyard 7&8 2007 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Bring this bottle straight to the cellar. Don't even think about opening it before, say, 2013. All you'll get is a mouthful of hard, sandpapery tannins. But it's a very deeply flavored Cabernet, packed with massive blackberry, black currant, plum and cedar flavors, and there's a granitic minerality that must come from the soil. Very finely crafted.",Anonymous,
1171,1172,94,Quinta do Vallado 2007 Reserva Field Blend Red (Douro),"From old, mixed planting vineyards in the Quinta do Vallado, this is an impressively complex blend of flavors, from rich spice, smooth tannins, the richest plum juice and a gorgeous, opulent texture. It is ripe, drinkable now, but likely to benefit from several years aging.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1172,1173,94,Mercy 2008 Cedar Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"An absolutely delicious Pinot Noir. Hard to exaggerate the drinkability factor. Supremely ripe cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted by brilliantly crisp acidity to make it all bright and lively. Oak plays second fiddle, contributing rich, tasteful notes of smoke, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast. Just gorgeous for drinking now and for the next 5–6 years with your best fare.",Anonymous,
1173,1174,94,Andrew Will 2007 Two Blondes Vineyard Red Wine Red (Yakima Valley),"This Two Blondes is the best ever—powerful and ripe, with a plush mix of raspberry and strawberry fruit, tart and tangy and mouthfilling. This wine has a huge midpalate, but doesn't stop there; as it slowly winds through a full-throttle finish, threads of chocolate, coconut, caramel and coffee appear. The flavors go on for several minutes.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1174,1175,92,Iron Horse 2008 Native Yeast Chardonnay (Green Valley),"This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.",Anonymous,
1175,1176,92,J. Bookwalter 2007 Protagonist Red (Red Mountain),"Lushly aromatic and toasty, the substantial oak flavors are set against deep, brambly berry and cassis fruits. There are subtle suggestions of mint and some alcoholic heat, and an interesting orange peel scent carries into the mouth. The tannins are big and ripe and not at all bitter or too heavy.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1176,1177,92,Laetitia 2007 La Colline Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"A vigorous, masculine Pinot Noir. Dark in color, tannic and acidic, it has the weight of Grenache, although with silkier tannins. The flavors are impressively ripe and deep, suggesting raspberries, cherries, currants and a baked pie crust quality from oak. A bit ponderous now. Give it a good, long decant, or hold for up to six years.",Anonymous,
1177,1178,92,Quilceda Creek 2007 Palengat Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Quilceda's Palengat is now a proprietary blend, not a strict Cabernet as before. You can smell the violets amidst nicely layered aromatics, built upon layers of black fruits, cassis and dark, smoky elements. Smoke, earth, coffee, a hint of iron and rock continue into the midpalate, which loses a little density as it moves through the finish. That may be a reflection of the young-ish (7 to 10 year old) vines.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1178,1179,92,Arbor Crest 2007 Stillwater Creek Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A single vineyard, 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, this is deep, dark, dense, chewy and tannic. Yet it still captures some delicate floral aromas as well as smoke and rock and black fruits. You go from flower to fruit to earth and black olive in a rush of full-bodied flavor.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1179,1180,92,Braida di Giacomo Bologna 2007 Bricco della Bigotta  (Barbera d'Asti),"Here's a super-modern and thoroughly lovable style of Barbera with intense and complex notes of milk chocolate, big black berry spice and espresso coffee.

1180,1181,92,Brander 2009 Cuvée Nicholas Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, with one-quarter Sémillon, this white blend was aged on the lees in oak barrels. It shows the balanced elegance this bottling by Brander usually displays. Entirely dry, with a crisp burst of acidity, its flavors are of citrus fruits, white flowers, vanilla, minerals and a touch of tart, New Zealand-style gooseberry. Great with roast pork or, if you can get it, wild boar.",Anonymous,
1181,1182,92,Château d'Esclans 2008 Garrus Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"The top rosé from Sacha Lichine's Esclans estate, this is wood aged and the flavors of wood are apparent, if subtle. The wine has a great smooth texture, the fruit well integrated, showing richness as well as elegance. Not classic Provence, but certainly impressive.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1182,1183,92,Domaine Carneros 2006 Brut Rosé Sparkling (Carneros),"Sometimes you want the richness of a rosé sparkler, and with this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend, you get plenty of flavor. Although its dry, it's flamboyant in raspberries, strawberries and vanilla, along with the stimulating yeast of a great bubbly. Just great on its own, or drink with sushi or roast salmon.",Anonymous,
1183,1184,92,Maison Bleue 2008 Alder Ridge Vineyard La Montagnette Grenache (Horse Heaven Hills),"Fragrant and spicy, this opens with green pepper notes and boatloads of prickly/brambly raspberry/strawberry fruit.

1184,1185,92,Testarossa 2008 Rosella's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Made of equal parts ultraripe pineapple and exotic lime fruit, coupled with sweet, smoky crème brûlée and buttered toast from oak and lees stirring, this is a super-rich Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold; it matures and knits together as it breathes in the glass.",Anonymous,
1185,1186,92,Testarossa 2008 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Made in a leaner, acidic, minerally style, this bone-dry wine feels ultra-clean and distinguished in the mouth. It's austere, but you'll find a core of pineapples, apples and limes. Great with a shellfish-inspired risotto. Elegant and food-friendly, it should develop over the next 4–5 years.",Anonymous,
1186,1187,92,Mas del Périé 2007 La Pièce Malbec (Cahors),"How good to find a powerful wine like this with reasonable alcohol. For this is an impressively dense and concentrated wine from 50-year-old vines. The fruit is ripe, juicy and chunky to go with the polished wood. A wine for cellaring.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1187,1188,92,Notre Vin 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon Rosé (Howell Mountain),"A very rich blush wine made from the same Cabernet grapes that go into the winery's expensive dry table wine.

It's syrupy sweet, redolent of honey-drizzled, spiced poached pears. To quibble, it could be a touch more complex and crisp, but it is still a succulent mouthful of dessert wine for drinking over the next few years.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
1190,1191,89,Château Saint-Sernin 2010 Prestige Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),"This is a rich and structured wine from Heifara Swatvagher.

1276,1277,88,Bocopa NV Laudum Old Vines Monastrell (Alicante),"Raspberry and cherry aromas come with mild spice notes. This has a zesty, citric feel due to punchy acidity, while raspberry and red-plum flavors end tight, lean and fresh yet well focused. This is a nice, juicy Monastrell to drink now.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1277,1278,88,Brady Cellars 2012 Blue Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Made entirely from Cabernet from a single vineyard block, this wine explores the variety's more savory side, with aromas of leafy herbs, green pepper, cigar box, musk and dark chocolate.

1278,1279,88,Canoe Ridge 2014 Limited Edition Canyon Vineyard Ranch Cinsault Cinsault (Yakima Valley),"Vineyard-designated rosés are unusual in the state, and other Cinsault offerings unheard of at present.

1279,1280,88,Cascina La Barbatella 2012 Nizza La Vigna dell'Angelo  (Barbera d'Asti),"Aromas of oak, leather, plum, vanilla and espresso unfold in the glass. The concentrated palate doles out dried black cherry, blackberry jam, oak-driven spice and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannin. This has weight and a velvety texture but it isn't overly vibrant, so drink sooner rather than later.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
1280,1281,88,Castello del Poggio 2012 Masarej  (Barbera d'Asti),"Aromas of black plum, vanilla, blue flowers, baked earth and leather lead the nose on this bold Barbera. The big, chewy palate doles out juicy blackberry, black cherry, licorice, clove and orange zest alongside fresh acidity and round tannins.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
1281,1282,88,Cave des Producteurs de Vouvray 2012 De Chanceny Brut Excellence  (Vouvray),A significant touch of bitterness in this wine spoils the otherwise attractive tropical fruit. It suggests the wine is too young and going through one of Chenin Blanc's growing-pain stages. Keep the wine until 2017 when it will broaden out and be all about perfumed fruit.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
1282,1283,88,Saget la Perrière 2014 Marie de Beauregard  (Chinon),"Still young, this is a wine with fruit and acidity that dominate. At the moment, it is about stalky red berry fruits that need to soften into the smoky background. The aftertaste is perfumed and fresh. Let the wine age until 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1283,1284,88,Sbragia 2012 Home Ranch Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley),"This wine offers a ripe abundance of apple and pear, veering almost into tropical flavors. It conveys richness amid a streak of high acidity, the oak semi-restrained. It finishes in vanilla crème brûlée.",Virginie Boone,@vboone

1286,1287,88,The Divining Rod 2012 Divine Red (Lodi),"An attractively earthy, meaty character in the aromas and flavors is balanced out by an elegant texture, medium body and moderate tannins.

1287,1288,88,Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2014 Lahoma Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Zesty lime and lemon notes cut a razor's edge through this buoyantly fruity, floral dry Riesling.

1288,1289,88,Three Rivers 2013 River's Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sangiovese, Malbec and Merlot take the lead on this blend.

Sullivan,@wawinereport
1289,1290,88,Treveri Cellars NV Blanc de Noir Pinot Noir (Columbia Valley (WA)),"All Pinot Noir, this wine brings unusual aromas of lemongrass, strawberry, brioche and cherry. The smoke and savory flavors are lively with lemony acidity.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport

1291,1292,91,Hermann J. Wiemer 2014 Semi-Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Whiffs of crushed mineral and candle wax lend mineral intensity to crisp, concentrated green plum and honeydew flavors in this semi-dry Riesling.

1292,1293,91,Hiedler 2015 Urgestein Riesling (Kamptal),"Gentle Mirabelle and lemon envelope nose and palate in a refreshing but soft embrace. This delicate wine combines lightness of touch with immense and sprightly citrus freshness. It works like a lemon sorbet: it cleanses, refreshes and tones. The lasting citrus flavors are a real bonus.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
1293,1294,91,Licenciado 2012 Reserva  (Rioja),"Reduced, jammy aromas of boysenberry, plum and blueberry set up a woody, choppy feeling palate with tannins that need to mellow. Raisiny berry flavors are on the heavy side, while residual oak notes are prominent. A tannic, drawing finish is dense, woody and in need of settling. Drink through 2030.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1294,1295,91,Luigi Oddero & Figli 2010 Rocche Riviera  (Barolo),"Crushed aromatic herb, rose and red berry aromas take shape in the glass.

1297,1298,91,Schloss Gobelsburg 2015 Langenlois Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Fresh, herb and miso-tinged yeast for now is the chief flavor on this zesty, fresh and punchy yet slender little number.

1299,1300,91,Vignobles Laffourcade 2014 Château de l'Echarderie  (Quarts de Chaume),"Perhaps less intense than some wines from this appellation, this is still a sweet, honeyed wine that is shot through with lemon acidity.

1301,1302,91,Wieninger 2015 Herrenholz Grüner Veltliner (Vienna),"Freshly cut Conference pear peel notes abound. The palate has a slightly phenolic, pleasantly bitter edge that will come into its own with food. The beautiful pear and aloe vera notes last long after the last sip. This deserves a whole evening of your attention—the flavors here unfold slowly.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
1302,1303,91,William Church 2013 Gamache Vineyard Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Dark plum, black-pepper and fresh herb aromas intertwine with light barrel spices.

1303,1304,91,Domaine les Grands Presbytères 2013 Vieilles Vignes Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"The flinty soil of the area of Saint-Fiacre gives a strongly mineral character to this wine.

1305,1306,91,Efeste 2014 Evergreen Vineyard Riesling (Ancient Lakes),"The aromas of ripe peach, jasmine, honeysuckle and mineral pop. It drinks just off dry, with a spritz of stone-fruit and citrus flavors that extend on the finish.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
1306,1307,91,Enzo Boglietti 2012 Fossati  (Barolo),"Aromas of pressed rose petal, roasted herb and a funky but not unpleasant trace of game lead the way. The gamey note carries through to the ripe, chewy palate, together with juicy Morello cherry, raspberry compote, mint, clove and mineral while a saline note closes the finish. It's still young and tannic, but shows a certain rustic charm. Drink 2019–2025.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
1307,1308,91,Flywheel 2013 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),"Concentrated pomegranate, squeezed cranberry and fresh hibiscus juice pop on the nose of this elegantly restrained bottling that also has lots of wet cement and stony character.

1309,1310,91,Baer 2013 Callisto Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up half of this wine with the rest Syrah (40%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of blackberry seed, spice, black licorice and dark fruit lead to ripe, full and appealing black-fruit flavors. It's a hedonistic delight.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
1310,1311,91,Blackbird Vineyards 2015 Arriviste Rosé (Napa Valley),"Winemaker Aaron Pott saignées nearly equal parts Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon to craft this impressively complex, light-bodied and ethereal celebration of cranberry, strawberry and grapefruit. It shows more tartness on the finish as it pushes a final, refreshing suggestion of mandarin orange.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
1311,1312,91,Bonnet-Huteau 2015 Les Gautronnières Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"The wine is smooth, ripe and deliciously creamy in texture.

1312,1313,91,Carol Shelton 2015 Wild Thing Rendezvous Rosé (Mendocino County),"One of the deepest colored rosés around, this wine has fresh, exuberant red-fruit aromas, while flavors bring as much complexity and depth as many full-fledged reds. Made from Carignane grapes, it does not follow the current vogue of pale-pink wines and is worth seeking out for its concentration.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
1313,1314,88,Alexandria Nicole 2009 Quarry Butte Destiny Ridge Vineyards Estate Grown Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A blend of approximately 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot making up the remainder, this barbecue-ready wine is scented with dried herb and forest floor components. Brambly berry fruit and tart acids work to balance out the earthy tannins.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1314,1315,88,Anthony Nappa 2010 Bordo Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),There's a savage appeal (what the French call sauvage) to this unabashedly rustic Cabernet Franc that was fermented entirely using wild yeasts. Initial notes of tomato leaf and green stem blow off to reveal aripe red fruit with a gorgeously floral character. Tart acidity and a concentrated red-cherry flavor are accented with graphite and black tea notes.,Anna Lee C. Iijima,
1315,1316,88,Château Haut-Goujon 2008 La Rose Saint-Vincent  (Lalande de Pomerol),"This is structured and firm, with its dry tannins prominent along with blackberry and black cherry acidity. The wine does have density, a dusty texture and the chance to further age.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1316,1317,88,EnRoute 2010 Les Pommiers Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Very good and delicious, if not quite up there with the warmer vintages of 2007 and 2008. The winemaker has done a yeoman's job with this wine—considering the difficult vintage—coaxing out pleasant raspberry- and cherry-jam flavors.The finish is dry and spicy. Drink now.",Anonymous,
1317,1318,88,Fournier Père et Fils 2010 Côtes de Morogues  (Menetou-Salon),"One of the small Sauvignon Blanc areas close to Sancerre, Menetou-Salon produces a light, crisp and herbal style of wine. This fits that bill well, its freshness contained within the flavors of hedgerow fruits and tangy acids.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1318,1319,87,Clovis Point 2007 Archeology Red (North Fork of Long Island),"This has a pronounced nose, with aromas of black fruits swathed in savory dried herbs, mushrooms, game and smoke. The palate, by contrast, is juicy with tart black-cherry and berry flavors framed with ripe, but grippy, tannins. Pleasant now, but it could improve over the next 3–5 years.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
1319,1320,87,Montalbera 2010 Laccento  (Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato),"Aged only in stainless steel, this fragrant wine opens with floral notes of pressed violet and rose perfume. The palate is tight, sharp and fresh, but what really sets this wine apart is the delicate and feminine nature of its bouquet.",Anonymous,
1320,1321,87,Siegel 2011 Crucero Reserva Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),"A bit oily and fleshy on the bouquet, with toasty oak aromas. It feels good, with a proper meshing of acidity and body weight. Flavors of orange and apple come with oak-based cinnamon notes, while the finish is tropical, warm and long.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1321,1322,87,J Vineyards & Winery 2010 Robert Thomas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This vineyard produces quite good Pinots for J Vineyards. The 2010 is ripe enough in cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with good balancing acidity. It's a bit heavy, though. Cellar at your own risk.",Anonymous,
1322,1323,87,Joseph Mellot 2011 Le Montarlet  (Sancerre),"This is a soft wine, with light green-plum and apple flavors, and an asparagus edge that comes through on the finish. Ready to drink. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1323,1324,87,Kessler-Haak 2009 Turner Vineyard Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"Rich and dry, this has flavors of cola, cherry pie, bacon and black pepper. The tannins are firm, and there's a bright burst of citrusy acidity to make things lively. Not an ager, but it should benefit from another year in the cellar.",Anonymous,
1324,1325,87,Les Hauts de Tousquiron 2009 Cuvée Lucie  (Haut-Médoc),"This is a smooth, rich, wood-aged wine. It has wood aromas, but on the palate the wood has softened the black currant fruit, creating a wine that's elegant and full-bodied, with herbal acidity on the finish. Age for 1–2 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1325,1326,87,Longoria 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"With an earthiness that weighs down the cherry, cola and currant flavors, this Pinot tastes a bit heavy. It's properly dry, with good acidity and modest alcohol.",Anonymous,
1326,1327,87,Milbrandt 2009 Brothers' Blend Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Malbec, Cabernet, Tempranillo, Petite Sirah, Grenache and Mourvèdre are all here.

1327,1328,87,Montes 2011 Classic Series Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Varietally and regionally correct, with green, grassy, punchy aromas of citrus, white pepper and jalapeño.

1328,1329,87,Muscardini 2009 Tesoro Red (Sonoma Valley),"There are lots of delicious flavors in this smooth blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. It impresses for its voluptuous flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and sweet oak. It could be a little firmer in structure; it's soft and melted, like pastry filling.",Anonymous,

1330,1331,87,El Huique 2009 Reserve Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"A jammy raspberry aroma comes with a herb note and a pinch of varietal green.

1331,1332,87,Sparkling Pointe NV Cuvée Carnaval Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),"A fragrant cherry-blossom scent accentuates the fresh red-raspberry and strawberry notes on the nose and palate of this delicious, easy-drinking sparkling.

1334,1335,89,Winter's Hill 2015 Block 10 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Pure Pommard, this has more concentration and forward fruit than the other single-block wines in this series.

1335,1336,89,Adega Cachín 2015 Peza do Rei White (Ribeira Sacra),"Stone-fruit, orange peel and Ribeira Sacra's textbook schist-driven aromas make for a moderately complex and interesting nose.

1336,1337,89,Marqués de la Concordia 2006 Federico Paternina Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"First-take aromas of raisin and cotton candy are soft and sweet.

1338,1339,89,Karine 2012 Love Ranch Vineyard Syrah,"This is a sculpted, mature wine that has good complexity to its aromas, a core of vivid blackberry flavors and a seamless but moderately tannic texture.

1339,1340,89,La Chablisienne 2014 Dame Nature  (Chablis),"This is anything but a simple Chablis. Made from organically grown grapes, it's smooth, ripe and generous.

1341,1342,89,Paul O'Brien 2013 Reserva Tempranillo (Umpqua Valley),"The very limited reserve bottling sees two years of barrel age in 100% new French oak. In this vintage, there isn't quite enough fruit ripeness to match that treatment. The light elegant fruit flavors of pomegranate and wild berry are a bit overpowered by the darker smoky oak flavors. A stiff streak of espresso runs through the finish. Best to drink this now through 2020.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1342,1343,89,Plaisance Ranch 2014 Papa Joe's Private Stash Syrah (Applegate Valley),"This young, tight tart wine is a fine example of pure Syrah, as if tasted fresh out of the fermenter. Tart black cherry, cassis, coffee liqueur, vanilla and a light streak of metal all combine to make this a full fascinating example. The odds are that another three to five years of bottle age will continue to improve this wine, but it's already quite flavorful and interesting.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1343,1344,89,Plaisance Ranch 2014 Papa Joe's Private Stash Tempranillo (Applegate Valley),"This is a nice amalgam of loose threads—leather, tobacco, earth and coffee, with purple plum and pie-cherry fruit. The fruit flavors lean toward fruit leather rather than fresh-picked, and the tannins are a bit astringent.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1344,1345,89,Qupé 2015 Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Viognier (Edna Valley),"Extremely light in color, this age-worthy bottling offers very light, clean and delicate aromas of crisp Asian pear and Gravenstein apple. The sip is quite high-toned, with the slightest touches of melon, pear and citrus peels, showing deft restraint for an often unctuous grape. A hint of white peach arises on the finish.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
1345,1346,89,Chronic Cellars 2015 Purple Paradise Red (Paso Robles),"Another accessible, complex and tasty wine from the Beckett brothers, this blend of 68% Zinfandel, 18% Petite Sirah, 8% Grenache and 6% Syrah offers baked and fresh blackberry notes on the nose, alongside slate, lilacs and clove.

1346,1347,89,DeLille 2015 Chaleur Estate Blanc White Wine White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc (73%) and Sémillon.

It needs some time to settle in but shows a lovely sense of balance.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
1347,1348,89,Eola Hills 2014 Barrel Select Reserve Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This spent about a year in 30% new oak, and some portion was American. Those aggressive scents and flavors still dominate, with the typical vanilla and pickle-barrel highlights. More bottle age is in order for maximum enjoyment. At the moment the fruit is primary and the barrel notes not entirely integrated. Drink after 2020.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

1354,1355,89,Concha y Toro 2014 Marques de Casa Concha Carmenère (Peumo),"Cheesy smelling oak and slightly overripe fruit aromas are a little less than spotless on the nose. In the mouth, this is raw and saucy in feel, with biting tannins. Sauvage berry flavors are gamy, while this is drying, scratchy and rugged on the finish.

Merlot adds softer notes of cherries and violets. The Malbec increases the tannins, along with notes of grilled meat bone that Syrah, with its peppery, beef-jerky meatiness, enhances.

1378,1379,91,Benovia 2011 Bella Una Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The cool 2011 vintage has kept this bottling from being as ripe as previous wines from this producer.

1397,1398,89,Jean Berteau 2014 Reserve Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This is a bit rustic in style, with sweaty leather and clove notes layered over subdued fruit, but the roundness in the mouth and silkiness on the palate amply compensate.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz

1437,1438,87,Mackinaw Trail 2013 Unrestricted Passito Cabernet Franc (Lake Michigan Shore),"Using shriveled, dried Cabernet Franc grapes, this appassimento-style wine is a new endeavor in the Michigan wine scene, yet it might merit further experimentation for such a cool climate growing region. Initial notes of balsamic blow off to reveal notes of brandied cherries and dried hay.

1440,1441,87,Primosic 2014 Santa Lucia Pinot Grigio (Collio),"Gold with copper hues, this opens with aromas of wildflower, tangerine zest and a whiff of crushed stone.

1444,1445,87,Hirsch 2012 San Andreas Fault Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine starts with an enticing, perfumed spicy aroma. Once sipped, a big burst of dry tannins coats the mouth and makes the mild fruit flavors seem thin and spare in the middle. The structure and the texture seem to need more richness and depth from the flavors. Drink after 2020 to let the tannins mellow out.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
1445,1446,87,J. Portugal Ramos 2014 Smart Dog Red (Alentejano),"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Trincadeira named after Pingo, the winemaker's dog. It's fruity, juicy and fresh with fine acidity and the right balance of spicy tannins. It is ready to drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1446,1447,87,Kandarian 2012 Croft Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Willamette Valley),"Kandorian makes a stainless-steel version of Sauvignon Blanc, and also this heavily-oaked style, which is about as far in the other direction as possible.

1449,1450,85,Trapiche 2007 Oak Cask Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Opening aromas of cola and dark fruits are belied by the tangy, edgy palate that's fresh in terms of its raspberry and plum flavors but not all that deep or complex.

1451,1452,85,Xavier Flouret 2006 La Pilar Malbec (Mendoza),"Opens with fairly deep blackberry aromas, but there's also a stemmy edge to the bouquet.

1452,1453,85,Zuccardi 2008 Serie A Chardonnay-Viognier (Mendoza),"Mild, light aromas of apple, toast, mineral and petrol are solid before they evaporate, while the palate is easygoing and on target, with citrus and apple flavors.

1453,1454,85,Bodegas Julián Chivite 2008 Gran Feudo Rosado Rosé (Navarra),"Sweet and sour aromas amount to a prickly bouquet, while the palate has some flesh as well as freshness. Nectarine and spiced apple flavors are solid but pithy, and overall the wine is good but lacks concentration. Good for everyday quaffing.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1454,1455,85,Caves Aliança 2008 Galeria Branco Bical (Bairrada),"Initially a tightly textured, apple and pear skin flavored wine. As it opens up, it shows creamy, fresh fruit, with pear and white currant freshness, finished with green walnuts and a burst of acidity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1455,1456,85,DFJ Vinhos 2008 Grand'Arte Chardonnay Chardonnay (Estremadura),"Creamy, green plum- and wood-flavored Chardonnay, clean, somewhat anonymous. Hints of citrus and acidity help keep the wine fresh, giving a final, easy crisp finish.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1456,1457,84,Furlan 2008 Castelcosa Sauvignon (Venezia Giulia),"There's a pure almond note here of Amaretto, marzipan and almond milk. In fact, there's not much else except for distant notes of white flower and peach. The mouthfeel is tonic and fresh but thin.",Anonymous,

1475,1476,86,Château du Coing de Saint-Fiacre 2009 Coing de Sèvre Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"An intensely fresh wine, touched lightly by spritz that brings out the lemon character. The acidity lifts the whole wine deliciously.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1476,1477,86,De Sante 2008 Old Vine Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This is a richly sweet Chardonnay, made in the popular style, for drinking now. The orange, pineapple and apricot flavors are savory, and the oak gives caramel notes.",Anonymous,
1477,1478,86,Domaine de Pajot 2009 Les Quatre Cépages White (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne),"A very perfumed wine, with white flower aromas, flavors of herbs and spice. It has weight as well as acidity, a tangy structured edge. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1478,1479,86,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2010 Los Vascos Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Pungent and sweaty smelling, with nettle and other sharp aromas. Surprisingly, the palate is short on acidity so there's a flat feel along with green, salinic flavors that border on vegetal. For proof, there's a clear wave of asparagus to the finish. Not as good as in past years.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1479,1480,86,Esoterica by Kent Rasmussen 2008 Chavez-Leeds Vineyard Petite Sirah (Rutherford),"Rich in blackberry tart, dark chocolate, grilled meat, pepper spice and smoky flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. The acidity is strong and a little unnerving. Drink over the next 2–3 years.",Anonymous,

1484,1485,84,Herdade de São Miguel 2011 São Miguel Alicante Bouschet (Alentejano),"Wines at 15.5% alcohol suggest too much of everything.

1485,1486,84,Valentin Bianchi 2012 Elsa Bianchi Chardonnay (Mendoza),Light aromas of tropical fruits and white flowers are basic and open.

1486,1487,84,Vetrère 2011 Cré Vendemmia Tardiva Fiano (Salento),"This is a sweet and thin dessert wine with aromas of peach, pear and honey that are muddled at times. The price is pretty good, however, for those who want to try a late harvest Fiano Minutolo.",Anonymous,
1487,1488,84,Vinicola Fraternidad 2011 Nuva White (Valle de Guadalupe),"This is a blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Moscato that's yeasty and oaky on the nose.

1491,1492,84,Reustle 2010 Winemaker Reserve Prayer Rock Vineyards Syrah (Umpqua Valley),"An intriguing wine, with aromas of white pepper, smoked meat, herbs and red fruit. The palate can't deliver all that these aromas have to offer though, seeming underripe and without the structure to hold them together. Interestingly, it's aged in 100% new oak—half French and half American—but the wood doesn't show.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport

1495,1496,84,Unión de Productores del Valle (UPVG) 2012 Estacion el Porvenir Sauvignon Blanc (Valle de Guadalupe),"Flat early aromas seem smoky at first and then more like apple and papaya.

1503,1504,84,Casarena 2012 505 Chardonnay (Mendoza),"This standard Chardonnay opens with blowsy melon and papaya aromas. The palate holds onto that melony feel while dealing honeydew, papaya and fleshy apple flavors. The finish tastes sweet and kind of flat.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

1530,1531,89,Merryvale 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Rich, dense and cool, with an overt menthol streak. The fat, tangy fruit has a cedar edge and also a pronounced piercing quality. Round, voluminous, tannic and in general quite big. Now the wood is a bit heavy-handed. A year or two on its side should help it along.",Anonymous,
1531,1532,89,Robert Mondavi 1997 SLD Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"A little prune, cherry and tobacco mix on the nose with some leafiness, creating a bouquet similar to Bordeaux. Black cherry and licorice are the predominant flavors, and in the end game there's a subdued coffee-tinged, reserved character to it.",Anonymous,
1532,1533,89,Conn Valley 1997 Eloge Red (Napa Valley),"Fine berry fruit, dried flowers, and an olive note mark the intriguing nose of this very dry, even austerely elegant blend. Very mature, almost raisiny fruit and dark-chocolate flavors cover the palate. A full finish with tobacco notes wraps up this very masculine package. Hold until 2005.",Anonymous,
1533,1534,89,Cain 1997 Concept Red (Napa Valley),"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak. If any one thing announces itself here it's the wood, which keeps everything austere and maybe a touch overcharred.",Anonymous,
1534,1535,89,Lolonis 1997 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Redwood Valley),"Easy-drinking, this is an example of a lighter, but still very satisfying style of Cabernet. The bouquet is tart berries, cedar, tobacco and rhubarb. Smooth and evenly textured, the palate displays cola and sweet tobacco flavors. Tangy tannins and dried fruit and spice flavors on the finish close this forward charmer from Mendocino.",Anonymous,
1535,1536,89,Herzog 1997 Special Edition Warnecke Vyd Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill),"A big mouth-filling offering with lots of oak/cedar and coffee/mocha shadings. Sweet-and-sour stewed berry flavors and black-toast accents play on the fairly large-scaled palate. A tart chocolate note enters on the finish, which displays firm but fine tannins. It's the best Cabernet we've ever tasted from this Kosher winery, and it should improve over the next two to four years.",Anonymous,
1536,1537,89,Chimney Rock 1997 Elevage Red (Stags Leap District),"The bouquet offers intensely jammy prune and black-currant fruit, with tobacco and vanilla shadings making an appearance. Dark blueberry flavors, with some mint and a light orange-citrus note. Full grapey mouthfeel, a long finish, and dusty tannins. Almost drinkable now, but best after 2002 and until 2010.",Anonymous,
1537,1538,89,Domaine Denis Gaudry 1999 Pouilly Fume  (Pouilly-Fumé),"Crisp, with grapefruit aromas and flavors, this is textbook Loire Sauvignon Blanc. A mild smoky, mineral note adds complexity, and the full fruit is clean and ripe, yet not at all sweet. Pulls it all off with lots of class and style. This is still the model the New Zealanders are using in their Sauvignon Blanc efforts.",Anonymous,
1538,1539,89,M. Trinchero 1997 Founder's Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Plummy aromas, black-cherry and oak, and accents of vanilla and cream. It's tight now, fairly begging for time to unfold. Presently the cherry core borders on tart. With time it should soften.",Anonymous,
1539,1540,88,B.R. Cohn 1997 Olive Hill Estate Vyds Special Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Crisp in the nose, with nuances of graham cracker, menthol, mushroom and herbs. Those herbal notes carry into the flavor profile and mix with plum and oak. It opens up a little and becomes fairly friendly on the finish, where the tannins are medium.",Anonymous,
1540,1541,88,Liparita 1997 Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Packed in upfront, with some atypical grassy, wildflower aromas. Chunky fruit and Port-like flavors make a statement, as does a black-tea note on the finish. Slightly clumsy now, the hope here is that some time in the cellar will help weld any incongruent elements.",Anonymous,
1541,1542,88,Guenoc 1997 Reserve Bella Vista Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An inviting and fragrant nose of blackberry, soy, vanilla and pine opens this medium-weight offering. Tangy, with tart berry, brown sugar and tobacco, it has a bracing mouthfeel with firm acidity, reading almost like a Tuscan red on the palate. Tart and sweet, the finish is brisk.",Anonymous,
1542,1543,88,Louis Latour 1998 Château de Blagny Premier Cru  (Meursault),"Richly scented with citrus blossoms, mineral and spice. Nicely balanced and light, the flavors are layered and intermingled through an elegant, firm, satisfying finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1543,1544,91,Firriato 2012 Cavanera Covo delle Coturnie  (Etna),"Intensely floral aromas of violet, iris and rose emerge in the glass along with a whiff of dark-skinned berry. The savory palate offers juicy wild cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, mint and clove while mineral and licorice notes wrap around the finish. Close-grained tannins provide the firm framework.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
1544,1545,91,Frankland Estate 2014 Rocky Gully Riesling (Frankland River),"This vintage of Rocky Gully Riesling comes across as quite ripe and rich despite the modest alcohol content.

1545,1546,91,Girolamo Russo 2014 A Rina  (Etna),"Aromas of toast, hazelnut, ripe berry and spice lead the nose while the structured palate doles out succulent black cherry, crushed raspberry, fennel and mineral. Fine-grained tannins leave a firm finish.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
1546,1547,91,Goldeneye 2013 Confluence Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Strawberry jam and red cherries meet vanilla and nutmeg in this fresh, fruity but also complex wine.

1547,1548,90,Albert Bichot 2014 Domaine du Pavillon Clos des Ursulines  (Pommard),"With some firm structure, this wine also has great fruitiness.

1548,1549,90,Amador Cellars 2013 Cooper & Karmere Vineyards Barbera (Amador County),"Whiffs of cedar and baking spices lead to ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors in this well-balanced and easy to appreciate wine. The ample fruit flavors are hard to resist, and the supple, modestly tannic texture is just right.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
1549,1550,90,Andis 2012 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Amador County),"Meaty, smoky aromas and good, high-amplitude fruit flavors give a robust personality to this full-bodied, dry and firmly tannic wine. It will make a good pairing with pasta, roasted birds or grilled meat.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
1550,1551,90,Balthasar Ress 2014 Feinherb Riesling (Rheingau),"Blossoms and pink grapefruits scent this fresh, fruity wine. Off dry in style, it's concentrated in plush, tropical flavors of guava and mango yet calibrated neatly by a vein of lime acidity. It's guzzably fresh and approachable but refined enough for elegant dining occasions. Drink now through 2019.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
1551,1552,90,Bella Luna 2013 Bailey Ranch Riserva Zinfandel (Adelaida District),"Aromas of gingerbread cookies with a black-cherry glaze meet black gravel and a touch of asphalt on the nose of this complex and flavorful bottling. The palate blends the brightness of red cherry and strawberry fruit with a rocky minerality, spiced up by black pepper and settling into a plum-skin groove toward the finish.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
1552,1553,90,BKB 2014 Makena Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"The debut release for this producer is a bright garnet shade.

1554,1555,90,Boeckel 2013 Les Terres Rouges Pinot Noir (Alsace),"With a little airing, this wakes up to reveal dark red cherries held in a taut and firm body that nonetheless has a generous core. There is some gentle grip and frank, firm acidity. It's a very honest wine without any baroque frills—but bags of forthright appeal.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
1555,1556,90,Burgo Viejo 2013 Crianza  (Rioja),"Berry and cinnamon aromas are lightly woody and spicy. This is tannic but not mean or fierce. Flavors of oaky plum and berry fruits turn savory in front of a finish with a dry, snappy, slightly raw feel. Given that 2013 was a cold vintage, this Crianza deserves praise.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1556,1557,90,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Bastion Premier Cru  (Beaune),"Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1557,1558,90,Colliano 2013 Estate Bottled Ribolla Gialla (Goriska Brda),"This Slovenian Ribolla Gialla has aromas of peach and vanilla, with flavors of freshly baked peach pie, canned apricots and green apple.

1560,1561,90,Graveyard 2014 Mortal Zin Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Inviting aromas of baked blueberries are leveled by crushed asphalt and dried herbs on the refined nose of this bottling.

1561,1562,90,Kuentz-Bas 2014 Tradition Pinot Noir (Alsace),"Gentle spice and redcurrant notes promise a subtle wine. The palate does not disappoint and sings with translucent, light-footed elegance.

1562,1563,90,Lava Cap 2015 Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (El Dorado),"Light herb aromas and vivid apple flavors make this medium-bodied wine delicious, while the tangy, nervy texture keeps the mouth tingling.

1565,1566,84,Finca Patagonia 2015 Expedicion Merlot (Maule Valley),"Burnt and herbal plum and berry aromas are just good enough. This feels clampy due to hard tannins. Medicinal plum and cherry flavors come with a forced-oak element, while this is dry and tannic on a hollow finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1566,1567,84,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2016 Espirito Lagoalva Rosé (Tejo),"This is a light, bright rosé that is made to drink as young as possible. It is crisp with raspberry fruit and gentle acidity. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1567,1568,84,Santa Rita 2016 120 Reserva Especial Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Creamy aromas of milk chocolate and berry fruits set up a moderately gripping palate.

1568,1569,84,Santa Rita 2016 120 Reserva Especial Rosé (Central Valley),"This red-colored rosé smells a bit briny, like pickled strawberry. The palate is somewhat round, with initial flavors of raspberry and strawberry that turn a bit peppery on the finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1569,1570,84,Armstrong Family 2015 Dineen Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),"The aromas are surprisingly light considering the variety, with whiffs of both lime and peach. It drinks dry, with the variety difficult to discern.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
1570,1571,84,De Martino 2015 Viejas Tinajas Muscat (Itata Valley),"This tan-colored Muscat was fermented and aged in clay amphora, hence the “viejas tinajas” name. Aromatically, this is strained and smells vaguely of apricot and citrus peel. The palate is drawing due to heavy skins contact during fermentation and aging, while a short set of bitter apricot flavors is more challenging than pleasurable. Better to wait for the 2016. This is past its prime.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1571,1572,84,Sevtap 2013 Ayla Late Harvest Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley),"Walnut oil, orange rinds and burned caramel converge for a Scotch-like aroma on the nose of this late harvest wine. Sour orange and bitter walnut flavors show on the sip.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
1572,1573,84,Snoqualmie 2015 ECO Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Quite light aromas are followed by dry, somewhat diluted fruit flavors. The variety seems to get lost and it drinks more like a generic white wine.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
1573,1574,84,Viña Chocalan 2016 Reserva Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),Yeasty aromas of white flowers and ham don't stir much interest. This feels medium in body and fairly bland. Yeasty flavors of vanilla and white fruits are more nondescript than particular.,Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1574,1575,84,Viña La Fortuna 2013 Twelvestones Malbec (Lontué Valley),Creamy malty aromas of vanilla and baked berry fruits lead to an astringent palate with hard tannins.

1578,1579,84,DeLorimier 2013 Smith Orchard Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"Sticky, puckering tannins wake up the palate and grab it for a wild ride in this reserve-level wine, which is densely ripe and burly in blackberry and tar.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
1579,1580,83,Lacheteau 2015 Tip Top Pinot Noir (Vin de France),"This is a simple, fruity wine. Its red cherry fruit is cut with a stalky, crisp texture and layered with acidity. It's made to drink young.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1580,1581,83,Plaisance Ranch 2014 Ranch Red (Applegate Valley),"This is half Merlot, with Pinot Noir, Cab Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon divvying up the other half—a completely different Ranch Red than in 2013. It's sweaty and short, with some off flavors in the finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1581,1582,83,Quinta do Cavalinho 2016 Herdade dos Templários White (Tejo),"This is a very herbal wine with a grassy, perfumed character from the Riesling and Moscatel in the blend. It doesn't come off.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1582,1583,83,Famiglia Meschini 2015 Unoaked Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Aromas of pink grapefruit and passion fruit are more in the Sauvignon Blanc field than your typical Chardonnay.

1583,1584,86,M. Cosentino 2000 Cigar Zin Zinfandel (Lodi),"Here's a Port-like Zin to sip late at night as the snow falls and the chestnuts are roasting. Plum pudding, raisin, and dark-chocolate flavors, with slight residual sugar and enough acidity to make it bright and balanced.",Anonymous,
1584,1585,86,Kunde 1999 Shaw Vineyard Century Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"What does “briary” mean? Think about a wild black raspberry bush on a hot summer afternoon. The wood, the bark, the dust, the chlorophyll from the baking leaves and the berries, with that wild, primitive, spicy, fructose-sweet bitterness. This wine is bone dry and finishes with a tannic bite. Drink it now with sturdy chow.",Anonymous,
1585,1586,86,Calina 2000 Reserve - Cabernet Sauvignon/Carmenere Red (Maule Valley),"A straight shot down blackberry lane. The palate is all about the fruit; it's got lots of texture, and maybe even some tannins to shed. Finishes with gravel, herb and a certain meatiness. The nose—wood and maybe a bit of mocha—is not its strength.",Anonymous,
1586,1587,86,Beaucanon 1998 La Crosse Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"A Loire-like red wine, pleasantly light and fruity, it has black cherry and cola flavors and a real streak of earthiness. Dry, supple tannins provide structure, but it's pretty soft. From Beaucanon.",Anonymous,
1587,1588,86,Errazuriz 2000 La Escultura Estate - Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Attractive aromas of pear and coconut set the stage for clean, fruity pear and apple flavors. This wine is balanced, offering length on the palate and finish, but also defined flavors and freshness. By all indications it's well made, and best of all it tastes as it should. Best Buy.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1588,1589,86,Talley 1999 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Lush and opulent, with South Coast notes of tomato, cola and beet, crushed hard spices and earth and some pretty black-cherry fruit. It drinks very soft, almost disembodied, with scarcely a tannin to be found, and low acidity. It's elegant, but could use some more crispness and structure.",Anonymous,
1589,1590,85,Cockburn's NV Special Reserve  (Port),"The nose is bold more than stylish, powerful rather than seductive.  In the mouth, it's sweet, spicy and still very fruity. The body is a tad rough, with lively edges. Nevertheless, everything comes together nicely to offer a healthy, hearty drink.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1590,1591,85,Casa Julia 2000 Reserve Merlot (Maipo Valley),"Rustic and medium-bodied, this Merlot has a nice spiciness that would be a big hit at a backyard barbecue.

1591,1592,85,Plantagenet 1999 Mount Barker Chardonnay (Western Australia),"Leads off with dusty, nutty, sugary aromas, like the bottom of the bag of honey-roasted peanuts, but there's also hints of buttered toast, ripe pears and black pepper. Flavors are simpler—caramel and pineapple—and it's heavy on the palate.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
1592,1593,85,Willow Creek 2001 Unoaked Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula),"From a cool-weather region, this tangy, slightly sharp Chardonnay aims at a Chablis style and almost pulls it off. Smells ripe, with pear and guava notes, but the palate is less so—grapefruit and lima-bean flavors prevail.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
1593,1594,85,Lidio Carraro 2014 Agnus Merlot (Serra Gaúcha),"This Brazilian Merlot smells rubbery and gaseous, with saucy berry notes. In the mouth, this is severely tannic and drying.

1594,1595,85,Alfredo Roca 2015 Dedicación Personal Sauvignon Blanc,"Dusty stone-fruit and white-flower aromas are mature, while the palate is linear and citric. Dry salty flavors of pineapple and tangerine finish with notes of mustard, lemon and brine.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1595,1596,85,Casa Perini 2016 Macaw Semi-Dry Moscato (Serra Gaúcha),"Oily aromas of orange peel and tropical fruits set up a creamy low-acid palate.

1596,1597,85,Collemassari 2014 Rigoleto  (Montecucco),"Made with 70% Sangiovese, 15% Ciliegiolo and 15% Montepulciano, this simple wine opens with subdued aromas of leafy underbrush, nut and dark-skinned fruit.

1599,1600,85,Sofia 2014 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Monterey County),"Very light in color, this bottling by the Coppola family shows sweeter aromas of Gravenstein apple, ripe pear, honeysuckle and tuberose on the nose. It's also a tad sweet on the palate, especially for today's sparkling standards, but will surely attract a wide fan base thanks to apple custard, cotton candy and plumeria-like flavors, all dissected by racy bubbles and acidity.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
1600,1601,85,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune),"This small appellation is in the hills behind the Côte Beaune.

1601,1602,85,Mascota 2015 La Mascota Pinot Noir (Mendoza),"Generic berry and cherry aromas along with a note of asphalt open this Pinot Noir that struggles to define itself as Pinot Noir.

1602,1603,85,Midnight 2013 Moonlight Cabernet Franc (El Pomar District),"This wine's nose is a tad hollow, offering poppy seed, roast beef and black-fruit aromas. The palate conveys blueberry, blackberry and chocolate flavors, with a rising acidity on the finish.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann

1606,1607,85,Finca El Origen 2016 Estate Malbec Rosé (Uco Valley),"Basic aromas are low on fruit. This has a cutting, citric feel that's centered around juicy acidity. Sour grapefruit and tangerine flavors end with lasting citric acidity.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1607,1608,85,François Lurton 2015 Araucano Humo Blanco Edicion Limitada Pinot Noir (Lolol Valley),"Heavy, generic cherry aromas are a touch volatile. This feels full and bouncy, with juicy acidity.

1610,1611,93,Vignobles K 2014 Badine de la Patache  (Pomerol),"The wine, with its firm tannins and solid structure, is still young. The hints of black-plum fruits are way behind the structure.

1611,1612,93,Bel Colle 2013 Simposio  (Barolo),"Enticing scents of woodland berry, new leather, blue flower and baking spice meld together in the glass.

1613,1614,93,Jalits 2014 Steinberg Red (Burgenland),"A touch of black cherry with the faintest lick of licorice appears on the nose. The palate is equally reticent but incredibly juicy.

A cool and profound red, it draws you in with its inherent freshness.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
1614,1615,93,Domaine des Remizières 2011 Cuvée Christophe  (Crozes-Hermitage),"One of the finest Crozes-Hermitage wines I can remember tasting, this wine combines mouthwatering notes of hickory-smoked pork and dark berries.

1789,1790,96,Thörle 2011 Saulheimer Hölle Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Waxy minerals mingle with deep, concentrated tones of orange and tangerine in this lusciously sweet Riesling. Vibrant and complex, it's marked by tart tangerine acidity that sears through the midpalate. Swathes of saffron and exotic spice soften a long, lingering finish.

Prüm 2011 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Old Vines GG Erste Lage Dry Riesling (Mosel),"This late-release GG is a stunning showcase of how just a few years of bottle age impact a dry, richly concentrated Riesling. Yellow peach and grapefruit tones shine brightly still, but are glazed by layers of slick, penetrating minerals. While moderate in alcohol, it feels dense and creamy on the palate. The finish meanders almost endlessly, punctuated playfully by strikes of lemon-lime acidity. It's singing now, but should improve till at least 2020.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,

1819,1820,88,Merrill Cellars 2009 Reserve Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This is rich, round, toasty and chocolaty, and it is instantly accessible and mouth filling.

1845,1846,86,DFJ Vinhos 2005 Monte Alentejano Reserva Red (Alentejano),"There is an attractive mint character to this wine, that follows through to a juicy fruit character with a ripe blackberry jam flavor. The acidity keeps the whole wine soft, sweet and fresh.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1846,1847,86,DFJ Vinhos 2007 Alvarinho - Chardonnay White (Estremadura),"On the face of it, this is an unlikely combination.

1848,1849,86,La Posta 2006 Angel Paulucci Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),"Cloudy and a little stewy at first, which gives it a richer, plumper outward personality.

1871,1872,82,Viña Bisquertt 2013 Petirrojo Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Candied white-fruit aromas are generic and rudimentary. This feels flat and doesn't show much life on the palate. Flavors of canned pear, oak and related spice finish bland.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

1876,1877,81,Garces Silva 2012 Boya Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Odd aromas of pomegranate and grapefruit are off the grid. This is citric and austere in feel, with sour, herbal flavors mixed with oak. A minty, herbal, green finish raises questions.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1877,1878,81,Ascension Cellars 2010 Dalliance G-S-M (Paso Robles),"A dull Rhône-style blend, this is soft and hot with alcohol. You'll find some green vegetable and mushroom notes that mar the ripe flavors of red cherry jam.",Anonymous,

1879,1880,81,Vistamar 2012 Sepia Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"This perenially mediocre wine is a little worse in 2012.

Richter 2014 Brauneberger Juffer Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Puckery lime and lemon flavors collide into lavish streaks of honey and marmalade in this penetrating, lip-smacking kabinett.

1896,1897,90,Monmousseau NV Brut  (Vouvray),The tell-tale touch of honey so typical of Chenin Blanc gives this wine its creamy character. That contrasts with the tight apple texture and nutty character that add complexity to this delicious wine. It is rounded and soft while having the freshest aftertaste.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
1897,1898,90,Newton 2013 Unfiltered Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"New winemaking and a sizable replanting effort at the producer's Spring Mountain estate are starting to show dividends in this new release, a full-bodied style true to its heritage.

1898,1899,90,Pierre Sparr 2014 Mambourg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"The nose is an intricate blend of rose petal, sandalwood and the ripe red-speckled skin of plump mirabelle plums. The palate echoes this perfectly, with an off-dry, cushioned and plump feel that just bathes all the senses in ripe fruit. The warm finish again emphasizes the ripe, plump fruit.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
1899,1900,90,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2012 Matthew's Station Vineyard Tannat (Russian River Valley),"This is a thick, firmly structured version of a rare variety in California, smoky in black cherry and vanilla.

1902,1903,90,Luis Duarte 2014 Rapariga da Quinta Colheita Seleccionada Red (Alentejano),"This is a rounded, ripe wine that exudes black fruits, soft tannins and juicy acidity. It is fresh, tight with a mineral texture. The six months of wood aging has served to tame the firmest tannins. That means this approachable wine is ready to drink just for its freshness and fruitiness, although it will be even better from early 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1903,1904,90,Tolosa 2013 1772 Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Salt, chalk and grapefruit-pith aromas make for a judiciously restrained approach on the nose of this wine, which comes from heritage clones.

1904,1905,90,Hooker 2014 Breakaway Chardonnay (Knights Valley),"Akin to a lemon drop, this wine offers a richness of fruit and oak along with balance.

1905,1906,90,Palacios Remondo 2012 Placet Valtomelloso Viura (Rioja),"Waxy peach and baked apple aromas are a touch dusty as well.

1906,1907,90,Pazo de Señorans 2011 Colección Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Apple and peach aromas are smooth, sophisticated and minerally. This special-selection, aged Albariño is citrusy but full in body.

1907,1908,90,Adelsheim 2013 Zenith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Young and precise, this balances flavors of wild raspberries against a mineral foundation. Suggestions of wet stone and a dash of brown spices come through, with lots of supporting acidity. As it fades, there's a lick of chocolate from aging in 29% new French oak.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1908,1909,90,Airlie 2014 Dry Gewürztraminer (Willamette Valley),"Truly dry, with barely perceptible 6g/L of residual sugar, this is intensely aromatic. A strong and lingering impression of talcum powder dominates. It's a potent, powerful, penetrating wine, true to variety, but a bit of a challenge with food.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1909,1910,90,Bernardus 2011 Marinus Red (Carmel Valley),"Black and white pepper, boysenberries and roasting pork notes show on the fresh and vibrant nose of this blend of the five red Bordeaux varietals. Light and lively on the palate, it offers lots of boysenberry energy, with more pepper, thyme, cardamom and tea elements. It's a refreshing change of pace from a cool vintage.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
1910,1911,84,Snoqualmie 2014 Winemaker's Select Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Out of the gate, reductive aromas provide some distraction from the lime-leaf and stone-fruit aromas. It drinks quite sweet with abundant apricot flavors.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
1911,1912,84,Joseph Jewell 2013 Alderpoint Vineyard Pinot Noir (Humboldt County),Aromas and flavors like prunes and strawberry jam make an unusual combination in this full-bodied and uncomplicated wine. It is certainly fruity and generous in personality.,Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
1912,1913,84,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2011 Midnight Red (Napa Valley),"This wine combines 32% Petit Verdot with 28% Merlot, 26% Malbec and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon.

1913,1914,84,Cenay 2011 Rodgers Vineyard Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"Rustic, dark and deeply tannic, this wine is sourced from the Oak Knoll District of the Napa Valley, known for relatively cooler-climate varieties, though not necessarily Pinot Noir. It dances in dark plum and leather, finishing short.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
1914,1915,84,TerraNoble 2013 Gran Reserva White (Casablanca Valley),"If the blend of Riesling and Sauvignon Blanc isn't jarring enough, then the wine's combination of high acid and heavy oak should be.

1915,1916,84,Fulkerson 2014 Juicy Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Juicy sweet is an apt moniker for this fruity, forward Riesling. The grapey, sugary palate is a bit confected in style, but easy and approachable.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
1916,1917,83,Emiliana 2013 Natura Malbec (Rapel Valley),"Briary, herbal berry aromas take on a wet-dog scent. This feels shear and shrill, with high acidity and not much body. Sour black-plum flavors are highly herbal and borderline weedy, while a tart, scouring finish closes this out.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1917,1918,83,Falernia 2013 Reserva Pinot Noir (Elqui Valley),"Stalky, damp, funky aromas are not unusual for Elqui wines. This is mild in feel and registers as being in the Pinot Noir range. Rooty, bitter flavors are rustic and low on fruit. Heat on the finish is of no help.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1918,1919,83,Estampa 2014 Estate White (Colchagua Valley),"Bland, pithy citrus aromas come with notes of saline solution and pool water.

1919,1920,83,François Lurton 2013 Hacienda Araucano Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Earthy, leathery berry and mushroom aromas don't stir much interest. This feels tannic and heavy, while flavors of baked berry fruits and caramel finish hot and rugged.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1920,1921,83,Chilcas 2013 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Blatant aromas of popcorn don't allow for much fruit expression on the nose. This is heavy and lacking in vitality. Flavors of toast, burnt wood, barrel resin and tropical fruits finish soft.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1921,1922,83,Convergence Zone 2014 Drizzle Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Pinot Gris (Red Mountain),"This wine still seems to be in its shell, showing considerable reduction that persists in the aromas and flavors. It drinks off dry with broad apple flavors.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
1922,1923,83,Quintay 2014 Q Grand Reserve Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Red-berry aromas are damp, mulchy and not fully fresh. On the palate, this wine feels sticky, while flavors of briny, herbal red-berry fruits turn salty on the finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1923,1924,83,Stony Lonesome 2013 Estate Reserve Barbera (Finger Lakes),"An unusual variety in New York, this Barbera contrasts a rich, deeply black berried nose against a palate that's chock full of sour cherries and dusty mineral tones. It's a bit out of balance, with a short, craggy finish.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
1924,1925,83,Kunde 2013 Kinneybrook Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"There's a mix of sweetness and greenness to this wine, a 100% varietal that is somewhat dull and unformed on the palate. It finishes slightly sour.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
1925,1926,83,Tricky Rabbit 2015 Reserva Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),"There's nothing too tricky about this dilute, mealy smelling Sauvignon Blanc that's blended with 10% Carmenère for a reason we can't explain.

1926,1927,83,Falernia 2014 Reserva Pedro Ximénez (Elqui Valley),"Aromas of orange and tangerine are oily on the nose. Melon, papaya and almond-skin flavors end with creamy lees notes that give way to bitterness on a dilute finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1927,1928,83,Chono 2015 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"This opens like an exploding hand grenade filled with pyrazines and jalapeño extract. The narrow, acidic palate is lacking in depth, but at least it's fresh. Briny, green flavors of jalapeño and bell peppers never let go, while the finish is tart and green, with a lasting note of bell pepper.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1928,1929,90,Carpineto 2008 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"In this structured wine, aromas recall meat juices, black plum, bell pepper and cooking spices.

1929,1930,90,Casa Ferreirinha 2012 Vinha Grande Branco White (Douro),"A finely made wine that is smooth and ripe.

1930,1931,90,Casca Wines 2010 Monte Cascas Reserva Red (Douro),"Showing strong, dense structure, this is a full, tannic wine. It starts tough and dry on the palate. The fruit comes through slowly, revealing red berry flavors. It needs to age, so don't drink before 2015.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
1931,1932,90,Casey Flat Ranch 2010 Estate Red (Capay Valley),"This intense blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Mourvèdre is dusty in cassis and leather with nice layers of blackberry, too.

1935,1936,90,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier 2012 Dom Dry Riesling (Mosel),"Jasmine and honey notes are intensely aromatic on this dry, elegantly framed Riesling.

Perfect as an apéritif, or to accompany delicate fowl or cheese dishes.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
1936,1937,90,Boas Quintas 2009 Quinta da Fonte do Ouro Touriga Nacional (Dão),"A classic structured Dão wine that is very firm still and packed with tannins.

1940,1941,90,Ferrari-Carano 2010 Mountain Vineyards Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"An impressive Cabernet, but one in need of cellaring. The primary fruit flavors of blackberries and blueberries are delicious, as is the fancy coating of smoky oak. And the tannins are rich and sweetly ripe.

1941,1942,90,Finca Casa Lo Alto 2009 Reserva Red (Utiel-Requena),"Initial aromas are scratchy and piercing, but with airing this blend of Syrah, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon offers intriguing notes of vanilla, tobacco and charcoal. In the mouth, this is undeniably thick and tannic. Flavors are saturated and suggest blackberry and cassis. The finish leans toward syrupy but maintains acidity for balance. Drink through 2018.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
1942,1943,90,Grgich Hills 2012 Fumé Blanc Estate Grown Dry Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Like the label says, this wine is absolutely dry. It's also very crisp in acidity, with a mouthwatering tartness that has the taste of freshly-squeezed lime juice. The fruit flavors also include pineapples, grapefruits and Meyer lemons, with slightly richer notes of peaches and Asian pears.

1943,1944,90,Peter Lehmann 2008 Mentor Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa),"This is a full-bodied yet crisp and firmly tannic Cabernet that appears in need of further cellaring.

1948,1949,86,Henri Abele NV Brut  (Champagne),"Despite being under the ownership of Cava house Freixenet, Henri Abelé remains little known.

Below all that wood is a dry, crisp Pinot Noir with red currant flavors. Other wines sourced from this Santa Rita Hills vineyard have been outstanding.",Anonymous,
1950,1951,86,J. Dumangin Fils NV Rosé Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),"Soft and rounded, this is a full style of rosé, pushing red berry fruits, ripe strawberries right to the front of the palate.

1951,1952,86,McPrice Myers 2006 L'Ange Rouge Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"A little heavy and soft, and while it's technically dry, the wine has a chocolate-covered raspberry taste, sprinkled with anise liqueur, and made to seem sweeter than it really is from high alcohol. Tasty, but needs greater structure and finesse.",Anonymous,
1952,1953,86,Pommery NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"Crisp, dry, packed with juicy red berries. This still needs some bottle age, because it is still easy to taste the red wine that was used to give color.

1954,1955,86,Thomas Fogarty 2004 Vallerga Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A little hot and tannic, with a young Port feeling, except that the wine, which is 100% Cabernet, is totally dry. Hard to tell where it's going. Grown in Yountville.",Anonymous,
1955,1956,86,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2005 Indian Wells Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Indian Wells Cabernet Sauvignon seems a little reductive at the moment; odd, since the 2005 vintage was forward, almost fat, and the wine has been in bottle for quite some time. It should definitely be decanted and aired out before serving, which will help to push the fruit flavors forward. The finish is just slightly dilute, but the wine is well-made and may just be suffering from some of the occasional dumbness that strikes Cabernet.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
1956,1957,86,Finca El Portillo 2008 Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Uco Valley),"Honest Sauvignon aromas of citrus and grapefruit set out the welcome mat.

1958,1959,86,Brander 2006 Bouchet Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Made from the two Cabs plus Syrah, this bottling shows its typicity in the rustic mouthfeel and exuberant berry, spice and cocoa flavors. It's a dry, lusty red that will happily wash down savory stews and roasts.",Anonymous,
1959,1960,86,Chaltén 2007 Reserva Pinot Noir (Mendoza),"A lean and clean specimen with basic but familiar raspberry and cherry aromas.

1960,1961,86,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2006 Sin Zin Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"Jammy and thick, this is a simple but lusty Zin, powerful in fruity cherry, blackberry and cola flavors that finish dry and spicy. Great with barbecued steak.",Anonymous,
1961,1962,86,Sartori 2004 Estate Collection  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"Sartori's Estate Collection Amarone delivers soapy-floral notes that recall dried lavender and rosehip potpourri.

1966,1967,84,Il Valentiano 2008 Campo di Marzo  (Rosso di Montalcino),"There's a ripe, jammy aroma on the bouquet of this wine that is soon followed by toasted espresso, rum cake, spice and tobacco. The finish is harsh and strong, thanks to a combination of alcohol and high acidity.",Anonymous,
1967,1968,84,Makulu NV Sustainable Agriculture Perlè Moscato (Western Cape),"A spritzy and effervescent selection, the carbonation helps to lift the inherent sweet fruit aromas and flavors of guava, peach and mushy pear.

2003,2004,91,L. Tramier & Fils 2013 Collection  (Corton),"With gentle tannins and juicy red fruits this is a ripe wine that is developing fast.

2006,2007,91,Olivier Leflaive 2014 Narvaux  (Meursault),"Although this is not a premier cru, this 33-acre vineyard sits right next to some of Meursault's finest vines. The wine is mineral, tight and textured— a wine that should age. With touches of oak, spice and intense yellow fruits, it is ripe while still closed at this stage.

2007,2008,91,Pascal Jolivet 2015 Les Caillottes  (Sancerre),"This wine comes from an 8.6-acre parcel of old vines above Jolivet's home village of Bué.

2017,2018,95,Malat 2014 Silberbichl Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),"Lifted notions of bergamot, lemon and grapefruit set a fragrant, almost heady tone. The same riot of citrus tumbles forth from the palate—there is a linear dynamic that exudes liveliness and drive.

2020,2021,95,Bründlmayer 2014 Heiligenstein Alte Reben Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"A rich, nutty note hints at hazelnut, with lively citrus laying underneath. This vein of lemony verve leads the melody like the soaring, unfettered notes of a violin against a sonorous background.

The palate bristles with wonderfully tingling citrus freshness that highlights all the aromatic aspects in turn: the fruitiness, the ripeness, the savory backdrop of yeast and the light-footed but concentrated core. This is still very young but so ready and utterly irresistible, yet with the mileage to age. Don't drink too quickly—you'll miss the chance of savoring the peppery aftertaste.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2024,2025,95,F X Pichler 2014 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Wonderfully ripe flavors of juicy, yellow pear precede everything.

2025,2026,95,Josef Jamek 2014 Ried Klaus Riesling (Wachau),"Right now, although the nose is closed, exposure to air reveals the purity of lemon oil on a taut and tight palate still singing with yeasty notes. This is in its very infancy and promises to open up beautifully with its straight, soaring backbone of freshness. Underneath all the tightly curled layers of citrus peel slumbers a salty stoniness that signals ageability; the long, lemony finish corroborates this. How utterly lip-smacking.

2027,2028,95,Malat 2014 Gottschelle Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"An almost tropical touch of passion fruit hovers above the nose as if to draw you in. Once imbibed, this reveals a concentrated but nonetheless light-footed charm that captures all the spiciness of a ripe, yellow grapefruit—pith, peel and pulp. This is appetizing with immense drive and energy. At the core, however, there is a calm and confident purity. This is alive.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2028,2029,95,Muhr-Van der Niepoort 2013 Spitzerberg Blaufränkisch (Carnuntum),"Very pure and lifted notes of red cherry are held tightly within a taut frame: the nose gives almost nothing away. The palate provides another glimpse of that hauntingly delicious, almost sublimated cherry note. There is something aromatic and pure, unforced and honest about this disarming wine.

The palate tinges the fruit with far more savoriness: the full force of yeasty spice, something herbal and salty and incredibly moreish. Citrus also provides a wonderfully high-toned dimension that suggests pink grapefruit zest and kumquats. This is toned, concentrated and full of verve.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2031,2032,95,Eichinger 2014 Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Initially tightly closed on nose, this wine slowly emerges with time in the glass. The palate is more expressive, with sprightly lemon, aloe vera and the soothing notion of ripe green and yellow pears. There are pleasing shadows of pepper and herbal spice, but what is most convincing is the compact, complete fluidity with which this envelopes the palate. Another masterpiece that is so very true to its vintage from Birgit's talented hands.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2032,2033,95,Emmerich Knoll 2014 Ried Pfaffenberg Selection Riesling (Wachau),"An enticing smell of lemon sorbet fills the nose and the effect on the palate is much the same: bracing, cleansing deliciousness pervades everything. There is a hint of crunchy, crisp green apple combined with far richer notions of lemon zest and mandarin peel. Deeper down resides an earthy, yeasty core and a salty, stoniness. This is very young now and will show its true but thrilling citrus-tinted colors with some bottle age. Drink 2018–2025.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2033,2034,95,F X Pichler 2014 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"A barely-there glimpse of lemon bids you to step closer and take a sip. The palate unfolds in a still tightly contained bundle of lemon zest and juiciness. There is an undertow of riper texture, reminiscent of bitter orange zest and just as full of aromatic promise. This is wiry and slender but will mellow into seductive freshness and slick, almost cheeky tartness. With this concentration, it has all the makings of a flavor bomb and is something to really look forward to. Drink 2018–2030.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2034,2035,95,Malat 2014 Alte Reben Höhlgraben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"A touch of flint on fleshy peach is followed by juicy citrus and ripe pear bedded in nettle and watercress. Together they present an immensely enticing nose, hinting at whole oceans of luscious fruit beneath the surface. The palate then invokes all the varietal spice: white pepper, arugula and chervil, illuminated by bright, zesty citrus to finish in a concert of layered zestiness. Overtones of orange and pink grapefruit zest make it even more compelling. Lip-smackingly irresistible and a paradigm of its vintage.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2035,2036,95,Proidl 2014 Senftenberger Ehrenfels Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"Watercress and fleshy apricot meet in this wine and make that incongruous combination work. A savory undertone of yeast adds a deeper dimension where pepper, chervil, lovage and stone abandon themselves to riot. This so comes alive in the mouth and demands your attention. Wonderful balance, ripe fruit and a whole lot of savory play!",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2036,2037,94,Emmerich Knoll 2014 Loibner Federspiel Riesling (Wachau),"The alluring lightness of scent here conjures up citrus-flavored snowflakes—symmetrical and delicate little crystals of lemony deliciousness that melt on the tongue one by one, releasing a constant stimulus of utterly joyous freshness—whichever cloud they fell from. It simply bursts with lemon and grapefruit zest, and even with lime. Slender, incisive purity echoes long in a blizzard of bracing and lasting thrill.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2037,2038,84,Candido 1997 Riserva Red (Salice Salentino),"Emanating from the heel of the Italian boot, close to the beautiful city of Lecce, this is one of Puglia’s classic wines. The grapes are Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera. Pleasant cherry-berry aromas and flavors predominate. The structure is ample, as is the mouthfeel. The tannins need some softening. The finish is long. Grilled lamb would make a fine accompaniment.",Anonymous,
2038,2039,84,Hermann J. Wiemer 1997 Cuvée Brut 2000  (Finger Lakes),"Overtly sweet aromas and flavors dominate this upstate New York offering. Wiemer’s wines have impressed us before, but this comes off as heavy-handed, with a dense, perfumey quality. It possesses decent length and texture, but the weighty sweetness makes it a better candidate for mimosas or for entertaining those who shy away from dryness.",Anonymous,
2039,2040,84,Delbeck NV Cramant Brut  (Champagne),"Aromas of apple cider, lemon and egg custard open this wine. Similar flavors on the palate, however, bear a bit of a musty note, yet the citrus is definitely there. Overall though, the soft, fizzy mouthfeel and fragrant, almost sweet perfume aromas do not display grand-cru elegance.",Anonymous,
2040,2041,84,Sella & Mosca 1995 Marchese Di Villamarina Cabernet Sauvignon (Sardinia),"Considered the flagship of the century-old Sella & Mosca fleet, this edition of 100% Cabernet Sauvignon disappoints. The supporting structure is fine, but the cherry fruit present on the nose and palate is too lean. The finish is short, too. This highly regarded wine is just not showing well at this time. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",Anonymous,
2041,2042,84,Freixenet NV Spumante  (Penedès),"The aromas are a bit candy-sweet, like pink bubble gum and Lifesavers, and in the mouth that impression of sugar is confirmed. The flavors are firmly on the peach side. It’s clean, but simple, and finishes a little sugary and syrupy.",Anonymous,
2042,2043,84,Château Frank NV Célébre Crémant  (New York),"A very light floral nose opens to an apple-cider and clove palate. The soft mousse and round mouthfeel set up for the clean apple and spice finish. A touch sweet, but it has a relaxed appeal.",Anonymous,
2043,2044,84,Santini NV Spumante  (Moscato d'Asti),"Distinctly lime-scented, almost like lime soap, and slightly sweet. There's a clean crispness that reduces the impression of sugar, and a lingering flavor of lime and orange. Like so many inexpensive Italian sparklers, this is flavorful party wine that goes down easy.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2044,2045,83,Bellavista 1991 Vittorio Moretti Reserve Cuvée  (Franciacorta),"The nose here is odd yet mildly appealing, with perfume and corn tortilla notes. Flower and fruit notes play on a palate accented by a soft mouthfeel and easy mousse. The finish shows a little length and a buttery, honeyed note, but overall it has a disjointed quality.",Anonymous,
2045,2046,83,Grandin NV Brut Sparkling (Vin Mousseux),"Earth and hay aromas open to an earthy tart-apple palate. There's an unusual mushroom note overall, and only a faint bead. Although the tart, dry finish is clean, it's low on zip and personality.",Anonymous,
2046,2047,82,Audubon Cellars 1997 Picnic Hill Vineyard Late Harvest Zinfandel (Amador County),"Exaggerated, burnt aromas of sun-dried tomato, raisins and plum liqueur don’t roll out the red carpet. Sweet (5.35% RS) and fruity, but also tannic and on the rough, earthy side. Ultimately it finishes short.",Anonymous,
2047,2048,82,Korbel 1997 Master's Reserve Blanc de Noir  (Russian River Valley),"This beery bubbly, with its flinty fruit and mouth-puckering acidity, is fine for parties or using as a mixer. It definitely sparkles. But it’s not Champagne, no matter what Korbel chooses to call it.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2048,2049,82,Remo Farina 1997 Ripasso  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),"The ripasso technique consists of passing the already completed “normal” Valpolicella back over the lees of the Amarone in the spring after vinification of the latter is complete. This results in a minor refermentation, adding extra alcohol and flavor. If the latter occurred in this particular version, it is not very evident. There is a modest amount of dry fruit present, but the mouth-searing acids and mouth-drying tannins hurt this wine.",Anonymous,
2049,2050,82,Terrale 1998 Bianco White (Sicilia),"Terrale translates as “product of the earth,” and that’s about all one can say about this wine. The grapes used are Catarrato, a white variety indigenous to Sicily, and the ubiquitous Trebbiano. A light apple nose starts it off, and the structure is good, with adequate acids. However, the finish is short and lacks flavor.",Anonymous,
2050,2051,82,Luna Di Luna NV Extra Dry White (Veneto),"This sparkling relative of a popular Italian table wine has a floral nose with a perfume quality. “Sweet” is the operative word here, with an almost candied edge to the fruit. It’s a quaff for the sweet-tooth crowd, or better yet, for making mimosas.",Anonymous,
2051,2052,81,Great Western NV Brut  (New York),"Anyone familiar with native varieties of grapes will recognize the “foxy” aromas and flavors in this otherwise well-made bubbly. The color, attack, acidity and finish are all good, and it’s dry as advertised, but that foxiness will be a problem for consumers used to vinifera grapes.",Anonymous,
2052,2053,80,Cristalino NV Extra Dry  (Penedès),"A strong wine, both in terms of aromas and flavors. There’s a delicacy and lightness to the body, but the intensity of its flavors is assaultive; it’s a combination of peaches, warm cheese and a hint of something very dry and citrusy. Roquefort notes indicate that there may be some bacteriological problems.",Anonymous,
2053,2054,95,Taittinger 1995 Comtes de Champagne Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"A beauty in every respect. The nose is perfectly toasted, with attractive apple and peach nuances. The palate feel and its full-fruit flavors build into a crescendo of Champagne style. It’s clean, lusty and just the right call for a celebratory evening. Mouthfuls of total harmony don’t come often and they don’t come cheap.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2054,2055,95,Laurent-Perrier NV Grand Siècle La Cuvée Brut  (Champagne),"One expects elegance, grace and precision from this prestige cuvée, and this wine delivers that and much more. There is a refined complexity running through it, from the cascading tiny bubbles to the lush, toasty nose to the dense, palate-tickling, complex mouthfeel, which continues seamlessly through to a long, ultrasatisfying finish. Stylish and seductive.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2055,2056,94,Acacia 1997 Lee Vyd Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"From the Napa side of Carneros, this beautiful wine begins with very forward aromas of cola, black raspberry, black cherry, tomato, mushroom, earth, vanilla, spice and smoky oak. Very fruity and lush in the mouth, with soft tannins. It’s rich and opulent, offering wave after wave of different sensations that are endlessly fascinating. The finish is fruity and long. Fabulous wine; enjoy it now, or age it.",Anonymous,
2056,2057,93,Acacia 1997 St. Clair Vyd Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"This lovely, powerful wine is very similar to the Lee Vineyard bottling, but slightly more backward. The fruit and spice aromas are a little earthier, like sniffing a handful of rich, moist humus. In the mouth, there’s just a tad more tannin, indicating, possibly, slightly longer ageability, while the finish is a bit harder. Nonetheless, this is terrific Pinot Noir, among the best anywhere",Anonymous,
2057,2058,93,Robert Mondavi 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"If you must open this now, let it breath for a while because it’s dumb, as they say, on opening. Airing and swirling reveal more earthy things than fruit. There’s a hint of truffles, of bark, and you almost have to close your eyes to imagine the blackberries and cherries buried deep down inside, but they’re there. You can taste them in the midpalate, and the finish lasts for a long time. Cellar this beauty and drink the regular Mondavi Pinot now and for the next five years.",Anonymous,
2058,2059,92,Heidsieck & Co Monopole NV Extra Dry  (Champagne),"Sharp, spicy fruit flavors lead into a thick, edgy, crisply defined sparkling wine with plenty of power. The heft and authority are there, but some softening around the edges would enhance the overall palate impression. Time should make this an even better bottle.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2059,2060,92,Wente 1997 Charles Wetmore Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"This beautiful single-vineyard wine takes all the themes of the regular Wente Cabernet and carries them into deeper, lusher, more complex territory. The color is darker, the depth of flavor more profound, the fruit veering more toward black currants, the tannins more refined, and the fruity-spicy finish simply wonderful and long.",Anonymous,
2060,2061,92,Louis Roederer 1994 Blanc de Blancs Brut  (Champagne),"From a vintage that frankly hasn’t impressed us much, this is a pleasant surprise. Full and toasty, with some yeast and butter, there are also youthful citrus elements of lemon and lime. A creamy texture and a long, smooth finish complete the package.",Anonymous,
2061,2062,89,Eufloria 2013 Aromatic Blend White (Washington),"This off-dry blend of Riesling, Chenin Blanc, Pinot Gris and Muscat shows the last grape first and foremost. The Muscat shines and shimmers with scents of orange blossoms and sweet, lively fruit. The wine is aromatic as promised, delicate and tilting toward the floral, though with good, solid fruit structure.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2062,2063,89,Fidelitas 2011 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Red Mountain),"This single-vineyard selection is 100% varietal, with deep cassis, dark chocolate and espresso flavors. The alcohol comes out as a slight burn, but the tannins have been nicely rounded off and this will drink well immediately.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2063,2064,89,Gård 2012 Lawrence Vineyards Freyja Viognier-Roussanne (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Firm and concentrated, this 80/20 Viognier/Roussanne blend brings bright and fresh scents and flavors of lemon peel and grapefruit, with bracing acidity. It's just right for warm weather outdoor dining.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2064,2065,89,Raúl Pérez 2011 Ultreia La Claudina Godello (Bierzo),"This opens with barrel-based aromas of resin and spice. It's round, creamy and Burgundian on the palate, with flavors of spiced apple, walnut and a hint of oxidation. Things flatten on the finish, which tastes yeasty and like toffee.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2065,2066,89,Regio Cantina 2010 Donpà  (Aglianico del Vulture),"This solid Aglianico opens with aromas of leather, underbrush, game and ripe plum. The structured palate delivers ripe blackberry accented by notes of licorice, sage and eucalyptus. There's a subtle warmth of alcohol and firm tannins. Best after 2016.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2066,2067,89,Roblar 2012 Gold Collection Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Minerality takes center stage on the nose from Roblar's top-end line of wines, with limestone and wet slate getting boost from fresh squeezed lemon. On the palate, the crushed rock flavors continue with some pear as well, making for a mellow sipping experience. Serve with shellfish, white fish or a soft cheese.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
2067,2068,89,Ryan Patrick 2012 Ryan's Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Here's a perfect go-to, every day Riesling for warm weather. Pretty fruit flavors of peach and apple are laced with orange pekoe tea. Medium-bodied and mouthfilling, it's got excellent length and structure.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2068,2069,89,Sevilen 2009 Centum Syrah (Aegean),"Inky red violet to the eye, this wine offers fragrances of blackberry, roast meat and espresso bean. There is a pleasing interplay between acidity and tannins on the palate, backing flavors of ripe cherry, almond blossom, Mediterranean herbs and a drop of salinity. Heading into the sleek finish, the plush texture does not overstay its welcome.",Mike DeSimone,@worldwineguys
2069,2070,89,Shiloh Winery 2011 Mosaic Red (Judean Hills),"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this deep violet-red wine has a nose of black cherry, crème brulée and black pepper. Cool and fruity notes play well together on the palate, shored up by flavors of black cherry, orange zest, menthol, clove and a touch of seawater. Mevushal.",Mike DeSimone,@worldwineguys
2070,2071,89,Terre di Giurfo 2012 Kudyah Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Here's a fresh, delicious Nero d'Avola, loaded with juicy blackberry and black cherry sensations that are accented by hints of black pepper and nutmeg. It's a delightfully easy-drinking, fruit-forward style meant to be enjoyed young.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2071,2072,89,Tortoise Creek 2011 Le Charmel Syrah-Grenache (Costières de Nîmes),"For the suggested price of $12, this delivers plenty of richness and flavor. Plum and briary blackberry aromas lead the way, followed by a medium- to full-bodied, slightly creamy palate that offers dark fruit tinged with a hint of brown sugar. Drink now–2017.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
2072,2073,89,Vivera 2010 Martinella  (Etna),"Made with 80% Nerello Mascalese and 20% Nerello Cappuccio, this opens with aromas of black fruit, subtle oak, toast and vanilla. The palate offers juicy black cherry and raspberry flavors that are lightly accented by notes of clove and chocolate. The tannis are polished.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2073,2074,89,Hovey 2013 Duende Chardonnay (Calaveras County),"A bold Chardonnay that embraces new oak barrels and has the flavor profile to show for it. Hovey fermented it in 50% new oak barrels, matured it on the lees and bottled it a few months after harvest. The scent and flavor of toasted oak comes through from the first sniff to the finish. But enough fruit, butter and almond flavors lie beneath the toasty overlay to make us come back for another sip.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2074,2075,89,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Réserve Personelle  (Pernand-Vergelesses),"A structured, cool wine that is poised and elegant, it has a lightly creamy texture cut by apple and pear flavors. Definitely mineral, it is textured with fruit skins and flavored with the oak aging. It needs to be aged, so don't drink before 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2075,2076,89,Juvé y Camps 2009 Brut Nature Gran Reserva Reserva de la Familia Sparkling (Cava),"Leesy, bready aromas are ripe and fruity. This is soft in feel and a touch heavy, which may be a reflection of the warm 2009 vintage. Nectarine and other ripe flavors finish full and sweet. This almost tastes like a brut Cava despite being a brut nature.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2076,2077,89,Laetitia 2012 Estate Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This is a very pale Chardonnay from Laetitia Winery, which sits just three miles from the ocean amidst vineyards planted on rocky clay loam, and yet possesses an appealing, complex mix of creaminess and crispiness on the nose. There is a slight bitterness on the palate as well as brioche and citrus zest on the finish. This tightly focused wine would perfectly cut the richness of shrimp scampi or other buttery dish.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
2077,2078,88,Louis Latour 2011 Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard),"With its tannins, the wine is firm, tight and dark. The black fruit flavors are just beginning to come through. It has power and structure and certainly needs to age. Drink from 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2078,2079,88,Maison Champy 2011 Aux Fourches  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),"Broad and rounded, it is full of sweet fruits and soft tannins while still retaining a good sense of structure. Red fruits come through strongly to give richness. It's for short-term aging.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2079,2080,86,Lucas Vineyards 2013 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Dusty, savory mineral and earth tones go head-to-head with fresh apple, lemon and lime notes in this crisp dry Riesling. It's a refreshing everyday wine marked by spine tingling acidity—a perfect pairing for creamy cheeses and rich braises. Drink now.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
2080,2081,86,Marchesi di Barolo 2014 Rurè  (Barbera d'Alba),"Young and fruity, this informal wine opens with aromas of dark berry, violet and a whiff of clove. The simple palate doles out tart cherry, raspberry, orange peel and a hint of white pepper alongside bracing acidity.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2081,2082,86,Maryhill 2013 Winemaker's Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas of basil, blueberry and char aren't entirely in harmony on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Franc. The fruit flavors come together better, sweet and palate-coating with a pleasing intensity.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2082,2083,86,Millbrook 2013 Block 2 West Chardonnay (Hudson River Region),"Cinnamon and cedar notes pepper this rich, full-bodied Chardonnay aged 18 months in French oak. Fresh apple and pear flavors are bright, but enveloped in a midpalate of butter and cream. Drink now.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
2083,2084,86,Domaine Sérol 2014 Cabochard Rosé (Côte Roannaise),"This lively wine is crisp, fresh and deliciously fruity. It is packed with juicy, fragrant acidity and wild strawberry fruit flavors.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2084,2085,86,El Pistolero 2014 Cold Steel Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Winemaker Mike Mooney named this after his great-great grandfather, who settled in the Central Coast region in the 1840s. The wine is light and nearly green in the glass, with lime blossom and green banana aromas that verge on tropical. It's extremely juicy and ripe on the palate, with some citrus-rind bitterness offering balance.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
2085,2086,86,Alliance Loire 2014 Domaine du Grand Breviande Rosé (Chinon),"Cabernet Franc produces lightly pink-colored wines, as in this bone-dry rosé. It is balanced between fresh raspberry fruits and crisp, nervy acidity. Drink now while it is still so bright and refreshing.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2086,2087,86,Baigorri 2010 Crianza  (Rioja),"This gets off to a clumsy start based on a nutty, rubbery, low-fruit bouquet. In the mouth, this crianza is pinched and tannic, with sandpaper rawness. Herbal, woody flavors of red plum end in a drawing, earthy finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2087,2088,86,Bocopa 2013 Alcanta Barrique Oak Aged Monastrell (Alicante),"Raisin and baked plum aromas set the stage for a somewhat flat-feeling palate. Plum and berry aromas are chunky and finish soft, with low acidity and not a lot of pop.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2088,2089,86,Brooklyn West 2012 Rockridge Red (Sierra Foothills),"Moderately sweet, this wine has attractive and ripe plum and strawberry aromas, then a soft, plush texture and light, fruity flavors. Made with Barbera, Grenache and Petite Sirah, it tastes sweet and easy to swallow but has plenty of body and alcohol to go with it.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2089,2090,86,Calcu 2012 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Plum and berry aromas come with a floral accent. This feels raw and a touch abrasive, with woody, saucy flavors of berry fruits and plum. The oaky, heavily spiced finish brings a grippy tannic feel.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2090,2091,86,Capoverso 2011 Cantaleone Sangiovese (Cortona),"Aromas of toasted oak, cedar, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose. The dense, one-dimensional palate palate doles out overripe plum, vanilla, game and a confectionary note. Buffed, fleeting tannins and soft acidity make this extremely accessible so drink now.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2091,2092,86,Castello di Querceto 2010 La Corte Sangiovese (Colli della Toscana Centrale),"This 100% Sangiovese opens with aromas that recall coffee, scorched earth and toasted oak. The fleeting palate offers espresso, mocha and a green note of powdered sage alongside astringent tannins. The fruit has mostly dried out.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2092,2093,86,Château la Nauze 2012 Identité  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux),"Dense and well structured, this is also a rich and juicy wine. It has crisp acidity, a fresh character that goes well with the firm tannins. Still young, this fruity wine needs to age, so drink from 2017. Marcel Verfaillie purchased the property in 2007. Enologist Jean-Marc Domme runs the estate; consultant is Thomas Duclos.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2093,2094,86,Santa Ema 2014 Select Terroir Merlot (Cachapoal Valley),"Tarry black-cherry aromas are a bit damp, oaky and scratchy, but overall this opens well. A solid, firm, edgy palate offers flavors of herbal blackberry and baked black plum, while the finish is meaty and a touch salty.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2094,2095,86,Stefania Mezzetti 2012 Lucumone Cabernet Sauvignon (Cortona),"This Tuscan red opens with aromas of red currant, cedar and espresso. The aromas carry over to the low-acid palate. The fruit is already drying up and the tannins are fleeting, so drink now.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2095,2096,86,Lyeth 2011 Chronology Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Dried cherry and cranberry combine on the palate around a trunk of smoky oak, offering a dry, black-peppery sensation. With 13% Malbec, it has a suggestion of blueberry going on as well, before a mid-length finish.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2096,2097,86,Massi di Mandorlaia 2008 Colpetroso  (Maremma Toscana),"Blueberry, blackberry, toast, spice and tobacco aromas lead the nose on this blend of 50% Cabernet, 40% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot. The evolved palate offers prune, raisin, cocoa, espresso and cedar alongside fleeting tannins. Most of the fruit has dried up, giving it a lean quality.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2097,2098,86,Pedroncelli 2014 East Side Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"This wine's a steal for the price, a no-oak white that's stony, tropical, ripe and simple. It'll serve well at larger gatherings or anytime with friends sitting on the porch or picnic blanket, staying balanced and refreshing in the glass.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2098,2099,86,Hedges Family Estate 2014 C.M.S. Unoaked White Wine Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas of apple, herb and mineral are light yet provocative.

It doesn't seem entirely varietal but offers plenty of enjoyment.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport

2100,2101,91,Amador Cellars 2013 Ottimista Vineyard Sangiovese (Amador County),"An attractive spicy, floral perfume joins rich fruit and spice flavors in this full-bodied, almost thick but luxuriously textured wine. An abundance of enticing oak aromas and flavors mingle with ripe cherry and blackberry notes, while piles of fine-grained tannin give a velvety mouthfeel.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2101,2102,91,Brooks 2015 Brooks Estate Vineyard Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills),"The vines date back to 1974, and there are suggestions of old-vine complexity throughout. The nuanced flavors mix Meyer lemon, apricot, peach and papaya, with defining acidity that is almost sweet rather than tart. A streak of minerality zips through the finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2102,2103,91,Chassenay d'Arce 2006 Brut Millésimé  (Champagne),"From a good vintage, this wine with its blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay has a pale gold color and attractive maturity. The initial fruitiness has given way to a mineral-textured wine with a touch of almonds, spice and a rich character. It is ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2103,2104,91,Château d'Agassac 2014 Pomiès-Agassac  (Haut-Médoc),"The second wine of Agassac is smooth, full of the fruit of this fresh year.

2104,2105,91,Château Sainte-Marie 2014 Alios  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),"Warm and ripe, this is a delicious, structured wine from a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot from Stéphane Dupuch.

Drink from 2019.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2105,2106,91,Domaine Charles Frey 2013 Plaisir Perlant Extra Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Fragrant notes of both green zingy fresh apples and more mellow baked apple fill the nose. The palate follows this with yeasty autolysis reminiscent of sourdough bread, dark honey and more refreshing green apple. The palate is lithe, dry and elegant with fine mousse and makes for a mouth-watering finish and a classy apéritif.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2106,2107,91,Eisold-Smith 2014 Fairsing Vineyard Pinot Noir,"A standout among the winery's vineyard designates, this puts ripe raspberry jam and cherry-pie fruit front and center. There's a dollop of balsamic and chocolate as well. Native yeast fermentation may have contributed to the unusual flavors of toasted peanuts that linger in the finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2107,2108,91,El Coto 2008 Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Crisp, direct, smoky aromas are intertwined with berry and oak-based vanilla scents. This feels fresh, easy and in the drinkability zone. Cherry, plum and berry flavors are bright for an eight-year-old wine, while the finish is more secure and solid than racy. Drink through 2021.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2108,2109,91,Elk Cove 2014 Goodrich Chardonnay,"This is the first Chardonnay from Elk Cove in 20 years. The grapes were pressed whole cluster and fermented in large French oak puncheons.

2224,2225,87,Dr. Willkomm 2012 Blue River Riesling (Mosel),"While sunny and ripe with scents of tropical fruit, orange and peach, this bang-for-your-buck Riesling reveals surprising complexities.

2226,2227,87,Poças 2013 Coroa d'Ouro White (Douro),"While the wine is bright, there is a serious side to it. The mineral texture and flavors of apricot and honey are paired with vanilla and grapefruit acidity. It is ready to drink, but will be better in mid-2015.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2227,2228,87,Quinta de la Rosa 2013 Dourosa Branco White (Douro),"This is a bright and fruity wine that is also rich. Yellow fruits are accompanied by fresh, textured citrus and given a crisp aftertaste by the lively acidity. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2228,2229,87,Ribafreixo 2012 Pato Frio Grande Escolha Antão Vaz (Alentejo),"This too-powerful, wood-aged wine is impressive but has lost fruitiness in the search for richness.

2236,2237,95,Eichinger 2010 Heiligenstein Erste Lage Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"The richness of this superb wine comes from the concentrated fruit flavors allied to the densely textured acidity and minerality.

This is a full-bodied, lushly textured, expansive wine, with a finish that seems to go on forever. Approachable now, it should age well for 10–12 years at least.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz

2244,2245,94,Verité 2008 La Joie Red (Sonoma County),"Right now this is not typically soft and lush like a cult Cab, but hard in tannins, with minerality like little particles of granite. Buried deep down is a pirate's treasure of ripe, intense blackberry fruit. New oak, to the tune of 94%, doesn't cloud the wine, suggesting this blend's its intensity and concentration. The wine is comprised of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, sourced throughout Sonoma County. Clearly this is one for the cellar; drink after 2018.",Anonymous,

2249,2250,94,Maison Bleue 2010 La Montagnette Upland Vineyard Grenache (Snipes Mountain),"This lacy, fine-tuned Grenache displays superb aromatics that are still a bit raw. One gets the feeling that as good as the juicy, young grape and berry flavors are, this wine has more complexity lurking below the surface.

2252,2253,94,Lancaster 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A great Cabernet that will proudly stand beside the best of Napa Valley. Made in the modern style, it's soft and sweet in blackberry, cherry, currant and dark-chocolate flavors, but the finish is thoroughly dry, wrapped in a scour of tannins and acids.

2253,2254,94,Lynmar 2010 Monastery Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Lots of toasty new oak marks this Chardonnay, as well as bright, citrusy acidity.

2255,2256,94,Clarendon Hills 2008 Astralis Syrah (Clarendon),"A step up from the other Syrahs in the 2008 Clarendon Hills' lineup, the Astralis is firmly tannic and should be long-lived.

Enticing aromas from the spice rack, milk chocolate and vanilla lead to meltingly rich fruit and cocoa flavors that are deep and focused.

2351,2352,90,Cumbre of Vine Hill 2008 Hicks Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Big, rich and fruity, with fantastically ripe cherry and Dr. Pepper flavors that are elevated by a note of sweet sandalwood, and brightened with crisp acidity.

2352,2353,90,Pride Mountain 2010 Vintner Select Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"This is always a gigantic wine, and its success depends on technically balancing its various parts. The 2010 delivers the usual richness, with vast, deep fruit, mineral, oak and leesy flavors. It's as full bodied as a red wine, but a little heavy for a Chardonnay. Not an ager, it's best enjoyed now with the richest Chardonnay-friendly dishes.",Anonymous,
2353,2354,90,Ridge 2010 Benito Dusi Ranch Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"A first-class Zinfandel, showing the variety's briary, brambly personality.

2354,2355,90,Sijnn 2010 White Chenin Blanc-Viognier (Malgas),"This blend of 57% Chenin Blanc and 43% Viognier is opulent and forward. Rich scents of baked apple, clove-spiked orange, honeysuckle and hazelnut crisp dance on the nose and mouth, but the palate remains lifted with fresh acidity and a saline note. Accents of spice and toast remain through the long close. A gorgeous wine now, but it should age beautifully through 2015.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
2355,2356,90,Türk 2010 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Harvested in December, this marries opulent flavors of honey and orange marmalade with intense acidity. Ready to drink in its youth, but it's likely to age for many years. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2356,2357,90,Josef Weger 2007 Maso delle Rose Pinot Nero (Alto Adige),"A bright and elegant red wine with a crisp, silky mouthfeel. The bouquet is redolent of wild berry, white almond, chopped mint and spice. This should pair with honey roasted ham or wild turkey.",Anonymous,

2362,2363,90,Gunter Triebaumer 2009 Reserve Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"Properly rustic, this has firm and dry tannins, a powerful structure to go with the wood aging and black plum flavor.

2366,2367,87,One Hope 2009 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A little heavy for Pinot Noir. Almost like Grenache, with deliciously sweet, full-bodied flavors of cherry compote and raspberry tart, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon. Give it a good decant and drink now.",Anonymous,

2370,2371,87,Francis Ford Coppola 2009 Black Label Diamond Collection 1910 Type Claret Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A rich, lusty wine, dry and easy to like for its array of blackberry, cherry, anise and sandalwood flavors.

2378,2379,87,Château Tanunda 2008 Noble Baron Shiraz (Barossa),"Already showing a bit of bricking, this is a full-bodied Shiraz that's a bit coarse in texture, with aromas and flavors of plum and brown sugar.

2381,2382,87,Michele Chiarlo 2010 Nivole  (Moscato d'Asti),"This precious Moscato d'Asti opens with soft foam and sweet aromas of peach, honey, almond blossom and jasmine. Pair this delicious dessert wine with fruit ice cream or semifreddo.",Anonymous,

2383,2384,86,Leopard's Leap 2009 Pinotage-Shiraz Red (Western Cape),"A funky edge frames this wine, both on the nose and in the mouth, and adds character to the otherwise straightforward blackberry, boysenberry and fig-preserve core.

2386,2387,82,Mont Tauch 2009 Le Dog de Christophe Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"Ripe raspberry, spicy red plum and licorice unfold on the nose, while soft flavors of cassis chime in on the palate. Light weight and watery with a short finish.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
2387,2388,82,Masies d'Avinyo 2008 Abadal Picapoll (Pla de Bages),"Oily and frankly a bit skunky on the nose. The palate is spritzed yet soft, with chunky, blowsy, generic white fruit flavors. Doesn't inspire; this winery's red wines are better.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

2394,2395,82,Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier 2009 Lieu Dit Malakoff Viognier (Pyrenees),"The wine looks a touch amber-like at the rim, with aromas of butterscotch and cracked pepper.

2396,2397,81,Piquentum 2008 Teranum Teran (Istria),Aromas of superripe red fruit and charred wood match the soft mocha and red fruit flavors on this Croatian red made from the Teran grape. Finishes a bit sour with mouth-puckering acidity and tannins.,Anna Lee C. Iijima,
2397,2398,81,Doña Paula 2010 Los Cardos Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza),"Hard, oily, prickly and not impressive by global Sauvignon Blanc standards.

2398,2399,81,Luigi Bosca 2009 Gala 3 White (Maipú),"Gold in color and about as overoaked as a white wine can be. This blend of Viognier, Chardonnay and Riesling is all resin and barrel spice. It actually offers some sophistication in terms of mouthfeel, but overall it's grossly out of balance and brutally dominated by oak-based aromas and flavors.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2399,2400,87,Midnight 2016 Aurora Reserve White (Paso Robles),"Clean and smooth lines of pear, lemon peel and nectarine are very fresh and easy in this blend of 71% Grenache Blanc, 15% Viognier and 14% Roussanne. It's straightforward on the palate, with Asian pear and melon-rind flavors. A great sunny day wine.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
2400,2401,87,Oddero 2014 Gallina  (Barbaresco),"This wine's herb, clove, coconut, leather and camphor aromas slowly take shape. The palate is rather raw, offering unripe sour cherry, cranberry, vanilla, espresso and star anise flavors framed by tight, grainy tannins that leave a raspy finish.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2401,2402,87,One 2015 Flock Red (California),A rich mouthfeel and considerable sweetness come with oaky spicy aromas and jammy fruit flavors in this full-bodied and rather tannic wine that was blended from mostly Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon.,Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2402,2403,87,Pico Maccario 2015 Tre Roveri  (Barbera d'Asti),"This wine's baking spice, vanilla and black-skinned berry aromas drift out of the glass.

2403,2404,87,Pierre-Yves et Olivier Fichet 2016 Château London  (Mâcon),"This is a warm, rich wine. Its fruit is muted at this stage although there's potential in the good acidity and smooth, juicy texture. Let it open out more and drink from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2404,2405,87,Sassi San Cristoforo 2012 Riserva  (Barbaresco),"Oak-driven spice, camphor and coconut aromas lead the nose of this wine. Tight, bracing and lacking fruit richness, it shows instead roasted coffee bean, toasted oak, dried cherry and vanilla notes. Astringent, grainy tannins leave a raspy finish.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2405,2406,87,Sean Thackrey NV Pleiades XXV Old Vines Red (California),"It's very difficult to rate this unusual bottling in a blind tasting. It's a nonvintage dry red wine blended from mature years and has few if any peers in California. It's very tasty because of traits that are usually considered flaws. A tawny color and an aroma like tawny Port lead to a very soft texture, and warm plum, raisin and nut flavors. The wine is rather full in body, light on tannins, and tastes quite mature and mellow.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2406,2407,87,Shenandoah Vineyards 2015 Special Reserve Zinfandel (Amador County),This is a great value for a wine from the celebrated Amador region. Aromas like strawberry jam and brown sugar lead to very ripe and fruity flavors in this full-bodied but lively wine.

2409,2410,87,Stottle 2013 Dineen Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"This opens with cherry cordial, cranberry, herb and barrel spice aromas that seem a bit off. The palate is marked by sweet cherry and cranberry flavors that trail off quickly on the finish.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2410,2411,87,Portal del Montsant 2011 Santbru White (Montsant),"Fully mature, oxidized aromas include a heavy note of popcorn and oak along with aged pear and apple. This wine is ripping with acidity, while flavors lean towards salty, lightly baked apple. A finish based mostly on acid means this should stay vital for years to come.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2411,2412,87,Ampelos 2015 Ampelos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Light in color and body, this restrained, classically styled red is tart in fruit character and acidity, with a thickness of concentration that surprises. A hint of reductive oak meanders through.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2412,2413,87,Boekenoogen 2015 Estate Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"There's a noticeably sweet quality to this bottling that will appeal to some but turn off others.

2413,2414,87,Bosco Nestore 2016 Donna Bosco Rosato (Colline Pescaresi),"This has delicate but alluring orange blossom, Mediterranean herb and wild berry scents.

2414,2415,87,Cà Bianca 2014 Antè  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),"This has black-skinned berry, forest floor and toast scents. The easygoing palate delivers tart cherry, vanilla and clove flavors alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2019.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2415,2416,87,Carmen 2014 Gran Reserva Los Quillayes Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Heavy oak on the nose means aromas of pencil lead, wet cement and blacktop are in the lead. This wine feels resiny and tannic, with a similar woody flavor accenting herbal black fruit. Although this is a good Cabernet, it's quite oaky.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2416,2417,87,Castellroig 2014 Terroja de Sabaté i Coca Xarel-lo (Penedès),"Briny citrus-peel aromas show a pyrazinic green side and a touch of corn tortilla. A somewhat dilute palate is bolstered by a shock of citric acidity, tasting of stone fruits and citrus. On the finish, early nectarine notes are replaced by briny flavors.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2417,2418,87,Château des Bormettes 2016 Cuvée Hélène White (Côtes de Provence La Londe),"From vines close to the sea, this wine does have a salty tang to its ripe soft fruits.

2418,2419,87,Codorníu NV Anna Blanc de Blancs Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava),"Basic white-fruit aromas get this wine going. The palate is full and mostly smooth, although maybe a touch flat.

2419,2420,87,Poderi Elia 2012 Serracapelli  (Barbaresco),"Prune, leather, oak and balsamic aromas lead the nose of this wine. The palate shows oak, vanilla, coconut and fig flavors alongside close-grained tannins. The fruit is already starting to dry out so drink soon.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2420,2421,87,Prinsi 2014 Gallina  (Barbaresco),"Woodshop, camphor and oak-driven spice aromas lead the nose of this wine.

Astringent tannins and firm acidity provide an assertive framework, leaving little room for fruit richness.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2421,2422,87,Scagliola 2014 Sansi Frem  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),"This leads with vanilla, ripe black-skinned berry and baking spice aromas.

2422,2423,88,Bodegas Palacio 2007 Glorioso Crianza  (Rioja),"Dry and spicy, with a note of bacon to go with red berry fruit and leathery aromas.

2424,2425,88,Miner 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a big, rich, extracted, dryly tannic Cabernet. The suggestion is ageability, but the wine seems to lack the dynamic tension to ride out the years. It has plenty of ripe blackberry fruit, but snaps to a quick finish. Quite good, but a disappointing expression of the Stagecoach Vineyard.",Anonymous,
2425,2426,88,Mont Marçal 2008 Rosado Brut Sparkling (Cava),"A subtle wine made entirely from Trepat. Aromas of strawberry and toast are mixed well, while the palate is juicy, crisp and correct, with raspberry and plum flavors along with a dose of dry spice. Light, toasty and perfectly dry on the back end. Nothing spectacular but gets things right.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2426,2427,88,Occasio 2010 Del Arroyo Vineyard Rose of Pinot Noir Rosé (Livermore Valley),"Occasio continues to build its case for being a winery to watch out of the Livermore Valley, releasing this lively, raspberry and honeycomb rosé made from Pinot Noir grapes out of its Del Arroyo Vineyard. The Pommard clone fruit was cold soaked in stainless steel, then pressed from the skins and racked again into stainless steel. A rosé with some meat on its bones, it's way more than an aperitif and will stand strongly aside a full range of summer foods.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2427,2428,88,Roessler 2009 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Roessler produces lots of single-vineyard wines, but this has not been one of their best ones.

The fruit is a mix of Bing cherry and strawberry, washed in a lush barrel-induced mix of chocolate, mocha, espresso and clove.

2430,2431,88,Abadía da Cova 2008 Barrica Mencía (Ribeira Sacra),"Smoky, rubbery and suggestive of bacon and toast on the nose. The palate is more crisp and snappy, with juicy flavors of red currant, cherry and spice. Acidity throughout yields a lemony finish, but it's also chiseled and tight, which should please traditionalists who like their acidic bite.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2431,2432,88,Avide 2005 Sigillo Red (Sicilia),"A blend of Nero d'Avola and Cabernet Sauvignon, Sigillo shows soft fruit and blackberry aromas backed by a touch of the greenness—bell pepper or crushed clove—usually associated with Cabernet. There's heft and structure in the mouth.",Anonymous,
2432,2433,90,La Chablisienne 2006 Mont de Milieu Premier Cru  (Chablis),"A ripe, full wine, immediately accessible, speaking both of minerality and fresh acidity.

2433,2434,90,Milbrandt 2006 Traditions Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"From a mix of Milbrandt vineyard sites, this outstanding blend includes small amounts of Cabernet, Syrah, Malbec and Barbera.

2434,2435,90,Montes 2008 Limited Selection Leyda Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Smells like an ocean breeze mixed with field greens, citrus and passion fruit. Montes has been a leader in Chile's movement toward coastal SB, and this one is blasting with grapefruit, green apple, passion fruit and minerality. In the mouth, it has some weight and richness; but that's balanced by zippy acidity. Can't imagine a better match for ceviche or tuna tartare.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2435,2436,90,Odfjell 2004 Orzada Cabernet Franc (Maule Valley),"Dark as night, with aromas of brick dust, kirsch and black fruit. Don't expect anything like French Cab Franc from this Chilean monster. It's huge and fully directed toward blackberry and cassis. Which means the herbal, leafy, tobacco notes common to CF are simply not present here. But if you like yours big and burly, with crusty dark fruit, then this is your ticket.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2436,2437,90,Errazuriz 2005 Don Maximiano Founder's Reserva Red (Aconcagua Valley),"The best Don Max in quite some time. After too many herbal-green vintages, the 2005 is ripe, rich and well woven. The bouquet shows hickory, roasted plum, chocolate, vanilla and peanut. The palate, meanwhile, is all about pure cassis, blackberry, mocha and spice. Finishes with a dash of caramel and earthy fruit leftovers. Honest, rugged and ready, but ageable for at least another 3–4 years.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2437,2438,90,Faiveley 2007 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis),"A wine that brings out soft richness, with a creamy apple texture layered with green plum skin tannins. The wine has some tautness as well, giving a tight structure that opens up. There's a great mineral, steely streak, with freshness showing through on the finish.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2438,2439,90,Barlow 2005 Barrouge Red (Napa Valley),"This is Barlow's Bordeaux blend. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's a beautiful wine, dry and balanced and fully ready to drink now, although it will take some years of cellaring. With fine acidity and tannins, it displays elegant flavors of currants and cassis, with rich edges of mocha and cedar.",Anonymous,
2439,2440,90,Castello di Gabbiano 2005 Alleanza Red (Toscana),"Made in collaboration with Beringer's Ed Sbragia, this super Tuscan blend of Merlot (75%), Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon is loaded with smoky tones of oak, leather, spice and chocolate fudge. The fruit is in there (behind the wood) and is redolent of blackberry and dried currant.",Anonymous,
2440,2441,90,Concha y Toro 2006 Marques de Casa Concha Cabernet Sauvignon (Puente Alto),"At over $20 the brand's Best Buy days are behind it, but this Cabernet still unfolds in serious but elegant form. The nose is dusty and dark, with cassis and blackberry aromas. Meanwhile, the feel is juicy and fresh, and the palate is just sizable enough. Flavors of cassis, chocolate and coconut are modern and friendly, while the finish of cocoa, mocha and marmalade is exciting.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2441,2442,90,Lost Canyon 2007 Morelli Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A bit awkward now, tightly wound and brittle, with very ripe cherry and currant flavors as well as complex Asian spices. Bone dry and marked by acidity, it could be a sleeper. Needs at least through 2009 to wake up.",Anonymous,
2442,2443,90,Maison Champy 2006 Les Enseignères  (Puligny-Montrachet),"This wine goes deliciously towards the citrus flavors, spiked with minerality. However it does also offer some richness, flavors of pears and ripe red apples, softened with melon. It is balanced, vibrant, a full wine that also shows structure.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2443,2444,90,Milbrandt 2006 Traditions Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Here is another great value from the Milbrandt brothers, based upon their impeccable vineyard sources (they own 1600 acres, mostly in the Wahluke Slope AVA). Dense and dark, ripe and compact, this Cab/Merlot/Petit Verdot blend brings plenty of macho and muscle, layers of black fruits, black smoke, black tea and black olives. Get the idea? It's a beautiful effort, and really shines at this price point.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2444,2445,90,Montebelli 2005 Acantòs Sangiovese (Toscana),"This is an organically farmed blend of Sangiovese (80%) and Syrah (20%) with elegant mineral tones at the back of red berry, smoke and campfire. Elegance and harmony stand out here and the flavors are smoky and ashy.",Anonymous,
2445,2446,90,Olivier Leflaive 2006 Montée de Tonnerre Premier Cru  (Chablis),"Firm and tight, a wine that reveals more structure than fruit initially, leaving the citrus and grapefruit flavors to emerge later. Then it closes up again, keeping some of the mineral austerity. Keep this wine for a year.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2446,2447,90,Podere Forte 2005 Petrucci Sangiovese (Orcia),"Dark density sets the tone and so do thick aromas of vanilla bean, toasted oak and coffee. The wine is firm but smooth and offers a blast of cherry freshness on the close. With all the oak, it's hard to find Sangiovese's naturally delicate nuances. Big, bold red wine enthusiasts will love it.",Anonymous,
2447,2448,90,Roessler 2006 Ridges Ollie & Hazel's Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tough and gritty in youth, this Pinot is showing edgy tannins, tart acidity and unincorporated oak. It's almost like a barrel sample. But it's stuffed with currant, licorice and mocha flavors, and should develop well in the bottle. Try after 2009.",Anonymous,
2448,2449,90,Santa Rita 2006 Medalla Real Special Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Few $20 Cabs from anywhere are going to deliver like Medalla Real does. From first impressions, which include aromas of toast, coffee, prune and devilish berry, you know it's a good one. The feel is generous and the balance spot on, so the plum, berry, coffee and chocolate flavors have structure and support. A complete wine with length, mint and lavish tannins.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2449,2450,90,Saudade 2007 Split Rock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Shows its cool-climate origins with a certain austerity that accompanies the exotic wild cherry, currant, Mandarin orange and root beer flavors, accented with sweet smoky oak. A rush of acids and tannins takes over the palate, strongly suggesting modest ageability. Give this Pinot Noir a year or two in the cellar.",Anonymous,
2450,2451,90,Soos Creek 2006 Sundance Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Sundance blend in 2006 is two-thirds Merlot, the other third splits Cab Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's what the winemaker modestly describes as his “leftovers,” but like the best leftovers it tastes great. It's wide open and broadly appealing, with sweet and soft fruit flavors of ripe berries, cherries and milk chocolate. Along with the ripe, fresh fruit are soft tannins and some pleasing streaks of coffee and licorice.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2451,2452,90,Tenimenti Angelini 2001 Val di Suga Vigna Spuntali  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This Riserva Brunello offers excellent dimension and depth thanks to its vibrant aromas of ripe cherry, natural rubber, cola, molasses and exotic spice.

2459,2460,89,Penley Estate 2011 Aradia Chardonnay (Coonawarra),"Coonawarra is Cabernet country, but this Chardonnay is a solid contender.

2460,2461,89,Abbazia di Novacella 2013 Praepositus Sylvaner (Alto Adige Valle Isarco),"Aromas suggest citrus, acacia flower, and hints of vanilla and honey. The creamy palate offers Bartlett pear, sage and lemon drop brightened by fresh acidity.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2461,2462,89,Campolargo 2013 Tinto Red (Dão),"This structured wine gives out a strong mineral texture as well as firm tannins that come from the dark black fruits.

Drink from 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2466,2467,89,Santa Ema 2012 Amplus Old Vine Carignan (Maule Valley),"Rich, chocolaty, toasty aromas of lactic oak and vanilla match red-fruit scents of raspberry and strawberry.

2468,2469,89,Ilsley 2010 Single Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Earthy, this wine offers substantial layers of dried herb and cranberry. Denser overtones of oak and tannin are pronounced on the midpalate, the tannins weighty and firm. A lift of acidity picks up on the finish. The wine will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2015.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2469,2470,89,Josep Grau Viticultor 2013 Vespres Red (Montsant),"Black cherry, plum and currant aromas are young, bouncy and fresh as a whole.

2477,2478,88,WillaKenzie Estate 2013 Jory Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Elegant and aromatic, this 2013 offers light flavors of apple and raspberry, a dusting of cocoa and excellent balance. It does feel a bit thin as it fades out, but keeps its definition and focus.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2478,2479,88,Irony 2014 Small Lot Reserve Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Light in the glass, this solidly priced bottling shows light vanilla, caramel sea salt, squeezed lemon and white peach on the plump and approachable nose.

2480,2481,88,Joseph Cattin 2014 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Muscat (Alsace),"An utterly seductive perfume of Muscat grape, honeysuckle and peach rises from the glass.

2482,2483,88,Viña Otano 2002 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Stewy, earthy and muddled on the nose, this gran reserva from a notoriously cold and wet vintage comes across as forced, as if long hangtime was sought to offset poor weather conditions. Stewy flavors of plum and spicecake finish flat and heavy, with tannic thud.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2483,2484,88,Abacela 2013 Barrel Select Garnacha (Umpqua Valley),"Spicy plum and cherry fruit is highlighted with a sprinkle of nutmeg. Sappy, tongue-tickling acids elevate the fruit flavors, while the wine finishes with thick, velvety tannins.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

2492,2493,88,Chacewater 2012 Nell Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"Coming from perhaps the best part of Lake County to grow Cabernet, this smooth and well-balanced wine is full bodied but light on its feet. It smells like raspberries and vanilla, and tastes jammy and almost sweet.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2493,2494,88,Croft NV Reserva Tawny  (Port),An immediately approachable tawny that has kept so much fruit while also bringing in the old wood aging flavors that give these wine so much fine character. It has bitter orange marmalade fruit and great acidity at the end. It is ready to drink.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
2494,2495,88,Dão Sul 2010 Cabriz Blanc de Noirs Bruto Touriga Nacional (Dão),"The surprisingly versatile Touriga Nacional has been used for this ripe and perfumed wine.

Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef) 2009 Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"This kabinett possesses lovely balance, marrying sweet pineapple aspects with zesty citrus notes.

2502,2503,90,Feudi di San Gregorio 2006 DUBL Greco Brut Metodo Classico Greco (Campania),"This is a very special, one-of-a-kind sparkling wine.

2503,2504,90,Feudi di San Gregorio 2009 Serrocielo Falanghina (Sannio),"This is a really fantastic wine and one of the best expression of Falanghina available today. (Perhaps the best.) What sets it apart is the purity of its fruit aromas. Citrus, white mineral and tonic fruit aromas hint at the crisp and smooth palate.  Would wash down well with fish, salad or spaghetti con vongole.",Anonymous,
2504,2505,90,Hartenberg 2007 The Eleanor Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),"There's a definite oaky backdrop to this wine, adding spice and toast to the rich baked red apple, peach bit and brioche flavors.

2505,2506,90,Sean Thackrey 2008 Andromeda Devil's Gulch Ranch Pinot Noir (Marin County),"An eccentric wine. Rather heavy for a classic coastal Pinot Noir, yet not without charismatic charm.

2507,2508,90,Stark-Condé 2007 Unfined and Unfiltered Syrah (Stellenbosch),"A bit more rustic than its Three Pines Syrah.

2508,2509,90,Stonehedge 2007 Terroir Select Grenache (Mendocino County),"A delicious Grenache sourced from Mendocino's Eaglepoint Vineyards, a high-elevation, cool-climate site with a peppery opening note that extends itself through dense chewy tannins and the bright fruitiness and inviting aromatics we all love about Grenache.

2509,2510,90,I Capitani 2009 Gaudium  (Fiano di Avellino),"Gaudium is a radically unique expression of Fiano that might not appeal to everyone but that definitely shows careful craftsmanship and execution.

2513,2514,90,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"In a flight of five 2009 kabinetts from the Sonnenuhr, this was the most alcoholic (at 9.5% abv), but the extra weight    didn't stand out beyond a bit of extra creaminess on the palate. Hints of lees and slate add complexity to the apple and citrus notes, then linger elegantly on the finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
2514,2515,90,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Lush, honeyed and tropically fruited, this epitomizes the Dr. Pauly-Bergweiler house style.

2600,2601,91,Tuck Beckstoffer 2010 Semper Ellenbach Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Soft, supple and mouth-coating, this wine dances in cola, forest floor and subtle red and black berry, building power and concentration as it goes. Already given time in bottle, it's ready to enjoy now.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2601,2602,91,Mark Ryan 2012 Dead Horse Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"This wine still seems to be in its shell with brooding notes of bittersweet chocolate, blackberry, raspberry and woodspice. It's a full-bodied mouthful of a wine. Layered black and red fruit flavors show good depth and density along with a firm structure of supporting tannins. Just a baby now, it should last well in the cellar until 2025 or more.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2602,2603,91,Merryvale 2011 Profile Red (Napa Valley),"The winery's top-end Bordeaux red, this blends 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Cabernet Franc, 19% Petit Verdot and 15% Malbec. The fruit is sourced from the family's estate vineyard on the eastern slopes of the Napa Valley, then aged 20 months in French oak, 90% of it new. Black in color, it tastes of cedar and smoke, with soft layers of subtle plum and cassis before a grippy finish. Enjoy through 2021.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2603,2604,91,Alain Brumont 2008 Château Bouscassé Vendemiaire  (Pacherenc du Vic Bilh),"Harvested in October, this gold-colored wine has a wonderful line of acidity that gives freshness.

2605,2606,91,Buena Vista 2012 Eleanora's Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Golden colored, this is a clean, hedonistic wine, with a nose of rich coconut flake followed by caramel and baked apple. Enjoy with winter fare or as a gloomy day turns to night.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2606,2607,91,Cellar Hand 2012 Punch Down Red (Okanagan Valley),"Principally Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this dark and smoky wine from Black Hills Estate Winery brings exceptional complexity to a more budget-friendly blend. Generous streaks of soy, espresso, dark chocolate and smoke wrap around a cassis core. The roasted black fruits and continuing flavors of smoke, tar and tobacco create a wine with power and length.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2607,2608,91,Chateau de l'Oiselinière 2007 Les Grands Gâts Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"As it ages, Muscadet becomes more like Chardonnay. Here, the wine has developed ripe tropical fruit notes and a smooth, creamy texture. The seven years of age has softened the fruit and acidity, leaving a rich wine that is deliciously ready to drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2608,2609,87,Veramonte 2012 Ritual Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"With yeasty aromas of Animal Crackers, vanilla and pear, this is more warm, soft and sweet than in the past. The year's warm characteristics are draped all over the palate, which is soft and wide. Flavors of creamy white fruits and vanilla finish with lychee and grapefruit. This lacks some spine and vivacity but will be good through the end of the year.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2609,2610,87,Viña Santa Cruz 2007 Chamán Gran Reserva Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"This earthy, concentrated Malbec is dense on the nose, with herbal flavors of blackberry, spice and heat. A toasty finish carries a choppy feel and fresh acidity, while the finish tastes toasty but doesn't rise up or improve. Overall, this is perfectly good but not complex. Drink now.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

2611,2612,87,Anton Bauer 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Wagram-Donauland),"Very pale in color, this is a fruity, fragrant wine. It has acidity, red fruits and a leathery texture. There is something of the undergrowth here, an earthy character that needs time to broaden out. Give the wine 4–5 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2612,2613,87,Anton Bauer 2012 Spiegel Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),"A light, refreshingly textured wine, very fruity and bright. Citrus and green plums cut through the tangy texture giving a clean, crisp character. The wine is immediately drinkable. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2613,2614,87,Emiliana 2011 Novas Gran Reserva Made with Organically Grown Grapes Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Rubbery red-berry aromas blend with spicy field scents to create a true Pinot nose that's a bit strained.

2615,2616,87,O•S Winery 2010 The Tusk Elephant Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"The bright cherry fruit is a bit high-toned, and the mouthfeel has a slight soapiness.

2616,2617,87,Rivetto 2010 Zio Nando  (Barbera d'Alba),"This Barbera offers rich black fruits, white pepper and anisette over a subtle layer of chocolate. Its nervous acidity is typical of the grape. This will get even better in a couple of years.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2617,2618,87,Jack Nicklaus Wines 2009 Private Reserve Red (Napa Valley),"This is a Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux-style blend with a splash of Syrah.

With blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it's obviously delicious, yet has a certain generic quality. Drink now.",Anonymous,
2618,2619,87,La Playa 2011 Axel Syrah (Limarí Valley),"This Syrah begins with subtle, mellow aromas of herbs and black fruits.

This is solid but regular on the finish, where herbal flavors are slightly toasted and show some heat.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2619,2620,87,Laetitia 2011 Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"This appealingly jammy wine is rich in red cherries and raspberries.

Drink from 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2621,2622,93,Pride Mountain 2009 Vintner Select Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This 100% Cabernet sure is oaky, but the butterscotch, toast and caramel flavors blend in seamlessly with the fruit, which is of gargantuan proportions. It's intense in mountain-concentrated blackberries, black currants and crème de cassis, with a complex note of green olives and mint. Just at the beginning of a long life, it will develop in the bottle for at least 10 more years.",Anonymous,
2622,2623,93,René Muré 2011 Clos Saint Landelain Vorbourg Grand Cru Vendanges Tardrives Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Gold in color, this sweet, spicy wine is full of ripe, opulent fruits and textures.

2623,2624,93,Seven Hills 2011 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Entirely estate-grown, 100% Merlot from old vines, this unfined wine is labeled vegan. Plush, briary, brambly fruit from the 30 year old vineyard brings an extra dimension to the wine, which shows a lovely balance of cranberry, raspberry, pie cherry and baking spice flavors.

2625,2626,93,Maurodos 2009 San Román  (Toro),"Take a hot year like 2009 and combine it with a hot region like Toro and what you get is this rich, ribald wine. Heavy aromas of raisin and blackberry suggest maximum ripeness. A beefy, saturated palate houses dark flavors of prune, chocolate and baked plum, while the finish is dark, toasty, chewy and a pure reflection of the Toro region. Drink through 2018.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2626,2627,93,Château Fuissé 2011 Les Brûlés  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"Complex wine that has both great fruitiness and great structure. It's very ripe, dense and textured, a wine with weight and a feeling of warmth. Brûlés means burnt because the vineyard has great exposure to the sun and that gives a powerful and concentrated wine. Age for 5–6 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2627,2628,93,Domaines Devillard 2011 Domaine des Perdrix Aux Perdrix Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"A dense wine, rich and smooth for a Nuits-St-Georges, full of ripe red fruits, dark cherries and acidity that almost gives the wine a fresh character. Behind this fruitiness is a more solid, dark structure of tannins that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2628,2629,93,Foxen 2011 Block 43 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A great success, especially given the difficulties of the vintage. With a modest alcohol reading of 13.8% by volume, it's exuberantly ripe in cherries and umami-filled red currants, with oak adding just the right notes of toast. Delicious now, but this is a Pinot that wants some age. Even better after 2017.",Anonymous,
2629,2630,93,Georges Vigouroux 2010 Cuvée Icône du Château de Mercuès Malbec (Cahors),"With a blackness that coats the glass, this is a huge wine, even before tasting. The palate, with its hugely dry tannins and immense structure, confirms this. It is dark in character, brooding almost, demanding many years to age. Drink from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2630,2631,93,Mumm Napa 2005 DVX Sparkling (Napa Valley),"This is the winery's top brut, and what a gorgeous wine it is.

Beautiful to drink now.",Anonymous,
2631,2632,93,Piña 2010 Ames Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A complex, ageworthy wine that combines contradictions but somehow is complete and wholesome. The cool vintage shows up in the form of green olives and sweet green peas, a taste that's unusual for Oakville but one that works well alongside the more traditional black currants and sweet oak. The tannins are pure Oakville, rich, ripe and dramatically layered. Beautiful in every respect, this 100% Cab will reward cellaring. Begin popping the cork in 2018.",Anonymous,
2632,2633,93,Royal Oporto 2011 Quinta das Carvalhas Vintage  (Port),"Dark and dense, the fruit dominated at this stage by tannins. This wine is solid, structured, firm and dry.

The fruit is cloaked with lush layers of barrel toast, and it may require several hours of decanting for it to open up. When it does, the flavors multiply on the palate with cassis, black cherry, dark chocolate, pencil lead and wood smoke, along with dusty, mouth-coating tannins.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2635,2636,93,Masi 2006 Mazzano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This Amarone has a fragrance that recalls black cherry and licorice, along with a hint of well-integrated oak.

2636,2637,93,Andrew Will 2010 Champoux Vineyard Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is a blend of Merlot (42%), Cabernet Franc (32%) and Cabernet Sauvignon coming from vines with an average age of 30 years. It has light but complex notes of cherries, plum, herbs, flowers and bittersweet chocolate. It's restrained and understated in style with seamless fruit flavors, mouthwatering acids and edgy tannins that need some time in the cellar to calm down.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2637,2638,93,Waits-Mast 2010 Wentzel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This lovely Pinot Noir has an appealing baked crust quality with structured, firm tannins and ripe cherry goodness all around.

2639,2640,93,Esterházy 2009 Trockenbeerenaulese White (Burgenland),"A very sweet wine that still manages to keep a dry element to it. It has as power, richness and great concentration, a smooth texture and final acidity. All in all, a wine that demands attention and aging.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2640,2641,93,Gérard Bertrand 2011 Tautavel Hommage aux Vignerons Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages Tautavel),"This is a dense, concentrated and expressive wine, although it's still young and promises more beauty and elegance with age. Aromas of African violets and cocoa nibs marry harmoniously with the fleshy black-fruit core. Jammy, ripe plum and cherry flavors lead the lush and slightly creamy palate, transitioning into notes of roasted coffee and chocolate, and finally ending on a sweet toasted-oak and baking-spice accent. It's richly delicious now, but patience will also be rewarded; try after 2016.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
2641,2642,93,Goldeneye 2010 Gowan Creek Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Silky and voluptuous, Gowan Creek is Goldeneye's larger production Anderson Valley Pinot Noir.

Will glide through the next 15 years easily.",Anonymous,
2643,2644,93,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2010 Elivette Red (Spring Mountain District),"There's lots of lush Cabernet Sauvignon character in this smooth Bordeaux blend. It has the all-important quality of impeccable texture, as soft as velvet, yet firm in minerals. With about one-third Cabernet Franc, it shows flavors ranging from cherries and currants to sweet cassis liqueur, with a complex veneer of new French oak. Beautiful to drink now, and it should age effortlessly for the next 10 years.",Anonymous,

2646,2647,90,Wine with Spirit 2012 Carpe Noctem Voyeur Limited Edition Red (Alentejano),"Put aside the bizarre name and label and concentrate on the wine which is fine, structured and densely tannic red fruit. The tannins and firm texture are balanced by black currant flavors and succulent acidity. The wine needs to age, and shouldn't be drunk before 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2647,2648,90,Siduri 2013 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A bit less intense aromatically than other Adam Lee bottlings, this shows sour plum, smoked meat and a touch of garden herbs on the nose. Those elements come alive on the palate, where peppercorns, oregano, thyme and pencil lead decorate dark cranberry fruits.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
2648,2649,90,Stoller 2013 Helen's Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This cuvée is made with the oldest Wädenswil plantings at the estate.

2649,2650,90,La Posta 2013 Fazzio Malbec (Tupungato),"Earthy, chunky plum aromas get nice accenting from baking spice and leathery notes.

2650,2651,90,Mr. Riggs NV Generation Series Battle Axe Sparkling Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"This medium- to full-bodied sparkler is pleasantly dry in style.

2651,2652,90,Mari 2010 Ultima Thule Red (Old Mission Peninsula),"Farmed under the winery's Nellaserra greenhouse system, this is an atypical blend for northern Michigan: 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Nebbiolo, 20% Merlot and 15% Syrah. This is a seemless mélange of spiced currant, cranberry and red plum, accented by warm spices and crushed violets. The round, medium-to full-bodied palate follows suit, with streaks of crushed stone giving levity all the way through to the lingering toasted-spice finish.",Alexander Peartree,
2652,2653,90,Novy 2013 Limerick Lane Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Grippy and somewhat subdued and tightly wound, this wine black in color and profile.

Drink now through 2023.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2653,2654,90,Peter Nicolay 2014 Dry Riesling (Mosel),"Waxy lime and lemon peels perfume this fresh, floral Riesling.

2655,2656,90,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2014 Lagoalva Barrel Selection Branco Sauvignon Blanc (Tejo),"Sauvignon Blanc and wood don't always go together. Here they do, because the fruit is still dominant, just supported by the hints of toast that have smoothed out the tense acidity and herbal character.

The finish is dry.,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2659,2660,90,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2013 WCS Jack John Grenache (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),"This is a rich and concentrated Grenache, a bit beyond what's varietally familiar, but it's an undeniably luxurious wine. It offers smoky vanilla, fresh leather, black-cherry jam, black licorice and a touch of fudge on the nose. Caramelized plum and olallieberries meet with balsamic fig and milk chocolate on the palate.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
2660,2661,90,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2014 Kaefferkopf Grand Cru Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace),"A very subdued nose leads to a rather earthy, dry palate where all the fruit hides behind some slightly rounded lemon freshness.

2839,2840,90,Finca Decero 2012 Remolinos Vineyard Petit Verdot (Agrelo),"Blackberry and prune aromas show herbal notes and a hint of dried leaf. Medium-full in size and friendly in feel, this has moderate acidity that lends freshness. Gritty, peppery black-fruit flavors finish with an echo of licorice and dark spice. Drink through 2021.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2840,2841,86,Château Peugeais 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Côtes de Bourg),"As this wine shows, what marks out 2014 is the great fruitiness. This is full of rich black currants from a 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A smoky background from tannins gives shape to the fruit and acidity. It will mature quickly; drink from late 2016. An Alliance Bourg member.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2841,2842,86,Chilcas 2013 Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Concentrated aromas of licorice, mocha and generic black fruits are low on elegance. This is grabby and strong, with herbal plum and cassis flavors that finish chunkily and deep, with good texture. Expect a saucy, herbal aftertaste.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2842,2843,86,Clavo Cellars 2012 Ole Albariño (Paso Robles),"Unique aromas of chamomile, dried orange peel, hay and smoked chicken show on the nose of this bottling.

2843,2844,86,Domaine du Claouset 2012 Réserve du Claouset  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"Produced mainly from Merlot with only 10% of Cabernet Sauvignon, this fat, juicy wine has red-berry flavors that are supported by dry tannins that are in the process of softening. Notes from the wood-aging also need to integrate. Drink from late 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2844,2845,86,Feudo Disisa 2011 Vuaria Nero d'Avola (Monreale),"Underbrush, toast and prune aromas lead the way. The lean, evolved palate offers raisin, dried blackcurrant, sage and anise but the fruit richness has dried out.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2845,2846,86,Gamache 2014 Estate Grown Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pear, almond and toast aromas lead to dry, elegant fruit and lees flavors. It's a uniquely styled offering of the variety.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2846,2847,86,Genoa 2014 Tell-Tale Super-Tuscan-Style White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of near-equal parts Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, this wine brings aromas of overripe pear and apple and toasted grapenuts that lead to dry, lightly fruit flavors. It's a straightforward quaffer.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2847,2848,86,Santa Alicia 2013 Gran Reserva de Los Andes Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Gritty, leathery aromas register as less than fully ripe. In the mouth, this Cabernet is a touch biting. Limited cherry and plum flavors come with burnt, herbal notes, while an earthy finish tastes of salt and chocolate.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2848,2849,86,Leto 2013 The Hidden One Old Vine Estate Grown Chardonnay (St. Helena),"From vines planted in the 1960s, and given time in 100% French oak, this dry, unctuous wine is tropical in character. A mix of pineapple and nutmeg teases its way into notes of canned corn.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2849,2850,86,Luis Felipe Edwards 2013 Marea Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Leafy, scratchy aromas of dried plum and raspberry give way to lemony, grainy oak scents. This is medium bodied, tightly wound and tastes of dried red fruits mixed with cocoa powder. A spicy, dry, crisp finish reinforces the wine's limitations.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2850,2851,86,Masseria del Feudo 2013 Rosso delle Rose Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Aromas of wet leaves, toast, prune and espresso lead the nose. The evolved palate offers fig, coffee bean, a hint of anise and a confectionary note alongside fleeting tannins. It's a bit muddled, with a short finish.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2851,2852,86,Wilridge 2013 Estate Wilridge Vineyard Barbera (Naches Heights),"The raspberry and cranberry aromas seem to show a touch of oxygen exposure. It's a pity, because the tart, lush flavors bring appeal.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2852,2853,86,Standing Stone 2014 Old West Block Riesling (Finger Lakes),"While the nose is a bit closed off, pristine apple, pear and grapefruit flavors shine brightly on the palate of this dry, brisk Riesling. Fruity, forward and fresh, it's an uncomplicated yet satisfying quaffer. Drink now.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
2853,2854,86,Stony Lonesome 2014 Estate Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Finger Lakes),"Zesty aromas of grapefruit and tangerine skins perfume this bright, citrusy Grüner Veltliner. While dry in style with a thirst-quenching, juicy demeanor, the palate is marked by curious hints of pollen and fennel. Drink now.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
2854,2855,86,Concha y Toro 2013 Casillero del Diablo Reserva Carmenère (Central Valley),"Black cherry, blackberry, olive and gritty oak aromas feed into a scratchy palate with forceful acidity. Oaky, blackened flavors of medicinal berry fruits finish with notes of mint and carob. Overall, this is solid but typically herbal and saucy.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2855,2856,86,Barker's Marque 2014 Arona Certified Sustainable Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This is a light-bodied, quaffable Sauvignon Blanc. Ripe aromas and flavors of peach and nectarine marry with passion fruit and some slightly discordant herbal notes, then finish quickly.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
2856,2857,86,Viña Casablanca 2014 Cefiro Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Casablanca Valley),"Aromas of olive, green herbs, mixed spices and black plum set up a full, grabby palate.

2857,2858,86,Luma Chequén 2013 Reserva Estate Bottled Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Earthy berry, olive and latex aromas are sleepy and chunky. In the mouth, however, this is more grating and alive. Flavors of earthy, salty plum and raspberry finish similarly, with bold acidity, liveliness and a salty after­taste.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2858,2859,86,Perry Creek 2011 Altitude 2401 Fair Play Farms Cabernet Sauvignon (El Dorado),This big but smooth wine has very ripe aromas and flavors that convey dried plums and rosemary. It's very full bodied and fine tannins keep the texture softer than usual.,Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2859,2860,86,Two Angels 2011 Mayacamas Mountains Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Grapes for this wine were sourced from the new appellation known as the Moon Mountain District, the higher-elevation, eastern-lying range above Sonoma Valley. The bottling also contains small amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Light bodied and restrained, it's briary, dusty and tannic, with sour cherry and cranberry flavors that get juicier on the finish.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2860,2861,87,Seufert 2014 Delfino Vineyard Dolcetto (Umpqua Valley),"Spicy cherry aromatics carry a touch of tack room leather. Those flavors follow, leading into drying tannins with a dash of dark chocolate. The wine seems a little confused about where it's heading, but it packs plenty of flavor at the moment. Drink up.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2861,2862,87,Sweet Cheeks 2013 Barrel Select Syrah (Southern Oregon),"The aromatics immediately catch your attention: an inviting mix of raspberry and tart citrus. The wine is tightly focused, with crisp edges around wild-berry flavors. Just a tiny hint of bloody beef moves it toward more Northern Rhône Syrah flavors.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2862,2863,87,Symington Family Estates 2015 Altano Red (Douro),"A ripe and smooth wine that has generous black fruits and a light touch of tannins. Coming from a good vintage, the wine is rich, packed with fruit and ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2863,2864,87,Undurraga 2016 Sibaris Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"This light-colored, almost clear, SB opens with pungent, fairly sharp aromas of sea brine and sweaty citrus fruits. In the mouth, this is tight, edgy and pointy due to blazing acidity. Citrus, bell pepper and green-herb flavors finish peppery and with scouring acidity.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2864,2865,87,Vignerons de Tutiac 2016 Carrelet d'Estuaire Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"Pay attention to the Tutiac winemakers north of Bordeaux, who have produced another good wine. Bright red fruits give it a crisp character, packed with acidity and lively fruitiness. It's a great summer apéritif wine. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2865,2866,87,Vignerons de Tutiac 2016 Lalande Bellevue Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"Intense acidity gives this wine character. It is taut and nervy, with a mineral texture. The bright, crisp red-fruit background to this acidity will assert itself over the coming months. Drink from late summer 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2866,2867,87,Auclair 2014 Left Blend Artz Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"This wine is 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot. Baking-spice aromas are at the fore, followed by dried-out dark fruit and herbs. The palate is reserved in style, with the tannins bringing some grit.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2867,2868,87,Martin Ray 2014 Synthesis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with 6% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot from several appellations within the Napa Valley is soft and smoothly textured, offering brawny black cherry and toasted wood flavors.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2868,2869,87,Montes 2015 Limited Selection Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Costa),"Rubbery black-fruit aromas are heavily oaked, so much so that this Cabernet-Carmenère blend smells charred but also like plastic. A big grabby palate is jagged in feel, while this tastes like the nose suggests, meaning oaky, herbal and like berry fruits and plum. A woody finish is short on total integration.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2869,2870,87,Montes 2015 Limited Selection Pinot Noir (Aconcagua Costa),"Dusty raspberry and plum aromas show a note of Band-Aid. This feels creamy and full, with black cherry, chocolate and oak flavors. An oaky essence carries onto the finish, which is chunky and lasting.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2870,2871,87,Nodland 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Aromas are barrel forward, with notes of char, vanilla, toast and sweet spice. The barrel notes continue on the palate, overwhelming the fruit almost completely. It's a shame as there's good things to be had underneath.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2871,2872,87,Quinta do Noval 2015 Cedro do Noval Branco White (Douro),"This is a lightly wood-aged wine, full of fruit with just a touch of spice. Smoothly textured, the wine is all the better for an extra year of aging before release. That broadens the fruit while leaving plenty of crispness and fine acidity. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2872,2873,87,Ribafreixo 2015 Pato Frio Grand Escolha Antão Vaz (Alentejano),"This is a young wood-aged wine with rich toast. While the toast does smother the fruit at the moment, there are enough crisp acidity and citrus flavors in the background to come through as the wine matures for another year or two. Drink from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2873,2874,87,Steele 2013 Goodchild Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Candied red and purple fruit meets mocha and cola spice on the nose of this bottling, which is approachable and simple.

2874,2875,87,Tertulia 2013 Phinney Hill Vineyard Carmenère (Horse Heaven Hills),"Aromas of whole green pepper, hot spice, cherry and baking spice are followed by lighter styled, tart, silky-feeling fruit and barrel flavors.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2875,2876,87,Viña Marty 2013 Ilaia Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Solid berry aromas don't go crazy with the oak, spice or herbal components. A chunky pulpy palate is a bit soft, while peppery herbal animal notes comfortably work their way into core blackberry flavors. Flavors of herbal fruits and cured meats lend quality to the finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2876,2877,87,Bodegas Bilbainas 2014 Viña Zaco  (Rioja),"This wine's heavy oak aromas are toasty but not overdone, while bacon and tobacco notes lurk in the background. Its raw, supremely tannic palate delivers woody, spicy berry flavors.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2877,2878,80,Brutocao 2005 Feliz Vineyard Barbera (Mendocino),"Has a sweaty aroma that's that's hard to get past. In the mouth, the wine is simple, sweet and sharp, with raspberry-mint jelly flavors.",Anonymous,
2878,2879,80,Fallbrook 2004 Special Selection Syrah (Central Coast),"There's nothing special about this Syrah. It's not only soft and semisweet, it's thin in fruit, with watered down blackberry jelly flavors.",Anonymous,
2879,2880,80,Grgich Hills 2004 Miljenko's Old Vines Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"This suffers from major problems. It has all the faults of a hot Zinfandel: semisweet baked-fruit flavors, a lack of acidity, and a resulting medicinal quality.",Anonymous,
2880,2881,80,Michael David 2005 Petite Petit Red (Lodi),"A blend of Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot, this is a clumsy wine. It's soft and overripe, and the oaky overlay doesn't do anything to improve the situation.",Anonymous,
2881,2882,93,Sineann 2005 Champoux Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (OR)),"Lovers of Cab Franc should track this wine down; it's a perfect evocation of the grape. Ripe purple plum flavors are annotated with spice and dust; the tannins are ripe and muscular; the wine sits very comfortably in the mouth. Hints of coffee grounds and tobacco liven up the finish, and the core of sweet fruit just keeps on coming.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2882,2883,92,Concha y Toro 2003 Carmín de Peumo Carmenère (Peumo),"Setting a new high bar for Carmenère is this luxury version from Concha y Toro's Cachapoal vineyard. And while it deserves to be drunk sooner than later, we recommend it for the best steak you grill this year. It's a strapped, juicy wine with tons of coffee, chocolate and berry essence. It's too hard or layered, so get at it soon for its up-front fruit and character.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2883,2884,92,Concha y Toro 2004 Don Melchor Cabernet Sauvignon (Puente Alto),"In recent years, with winemaker Enrique Tirado firmly at the helm, Don Melchor has gotten better and better. And while 2004 was an average year in Chile, this ranks as the best Melchor we've sampled. The wine has beautiful blackberry, cola and pepper aromas in front of cassis, cherry, plum, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors. It's brawny but balanced, with excellent natural acidity. Best from 2008–2012.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2884,2885,92,Viu Manent 2005 Single Vineyard San Carlos Estate Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"This score for a $22 Chilean Malbec may cause you to do a double-take, but this is really a great wine. The nose is chock full of berry aromas with earth and leather riding shotgun. Flavors and finishing notes of chocolate truffles, espresso, berry syrup and mocha sum it up. The structure is here, as is the core acidity. This wine has everything. Imported by Atlanta Improvement Co.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2885,2886,92,Capaia 2005 Capaia Red (Philadelphia),"Dark, rich fruit, luscious spice and a velvety overall texture make this flagship wine from Capaia a benchmark Bordeaux blend for South Africa. Assertive but refined, layered but delicate, the wine unfolds gently on the palate and is the perfect cohort to myriad meat and poultry dishes. Minerality gives it lift and clarity.",Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa
2886,2887,92,Tatiarra 2005 Cambrian Shiraz (Heathcote),"A big but balanced Shiraz, Tatiarra's Cambrian Shiraz takes its name from the ancient rocks that underlie the vineyards. Black cherries, licorice and mineral notes finish long, picking up nuances of black olives. Drink now–2015, possibly longer.",Anonymous,
2887,2888,91,WillaKenzie Estate 2004 Triple Black Slopes Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The name refers to the vineyard's unusually steep slopes. The reward for farming such difficult terrain, the owners believe, is complexity, character and concentration. That is certainly the case in 2004, as this is the most dense and focused of the six WillaKenzie releases. It's built upon a solid foundation of black cherry fruit, but elevated with herb, acid and a feathery touch to the tannins. Despite its exceptional heft, the wine manages to feel elegant.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2888,2889,91,De Toren 2004 Z Red (Coastal Region),"Plum and rose on the nose introduces this beautiful blend from De Toren, and on the palate, it shows ample structure and firm tannins with a shock of acidity that brings freshness to the overall flavor profile. Subtle, reserved strains of spice and soft fruit flavors end up with a clean and fresh twist. A unique and attractive wine at a good price.",Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa
2889,2890,86,Piera Martellozzo NV Perle di Piera Pink Pearl Rosé Sparkling (Delle Venezie),"Part of a series of sparkling wines from Piera Martellozzo, this is a blend of Raboso and Pinot Nero.

2891,2892,86,Rock Hollow 2010 Vintner's Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"Nicely crisp in acidity, this has a minerally scour that cleans the mouth. The pineapple, lime and guava flavors are strong, and the finish seems just a little sweet.",Anonymous,
2892,2893,86,Telavi 2009 Marani Tsinandali White (Kakheti),"While aromatically subdued, this is a refreshing, easy-drinking white blend, with pleasant lemon and apple flavors. A hint of orange peel and a brisk, lime-accented acidity highlight the midpalate. Drink now.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,

2895,2896,86,Botter NV Bolle  (Prosecco),"“Bolle,” which is Italian for “bubbles,” plays up its cheerful and playful side with bright aromas of citrus, peach, passion fruit and green apple. It washes down easily thanks to the wine's natural acidity.",Anonymous,
2896,2897,86,Casa Silva 2011 Angostura Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"This wine smells subtly of hickory and resin but is otherwise neutral on the nose. It feels creamy, smooth and woody, with oak leading the flavor profile, with other notes of melon and honey. This is a plump, oaky, honeyed style of Chardonnay.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2897,2898,86,Casal Paço Padreiro 2008 Aphros  Reserva Bruto Loureiro (Vinho Verde),"This crisp, bright sparkler gets depth of flavor from the Loureiro grape. It has a taut texture that makes this fruity, fresh wine a perfect match for food.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2898,2899,86,Château Maris 2009 Continuité de Nature Carignan (Minervois La Liviniere),"The aromas of this wine are slightly high-toned, offering bright notes of apple skin, tart cherry and small red-berry fruit.

2899,2900,86,Cramele Recas 2011 Paparuda Estate Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Viile Timisului),"Notes of cedar and violet meld with a ripe, juicy black-fruit flavor in this bold, deeply concentrated Cabernet. Softer and riper than the Rezerva, it has a slightly grapey midpalate. It's full-bodied in style, with a frame of lush, furry tannins.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
2900,2901,86,Dão Sul 2011 Cabriz Colheita Seleccionada White (Dão),"This round and smooth wine has apricot, peach and pear flavors, which create a soft texture and attractive acidity. It has a warm, rich feel. This wine is for food.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2901,2902,86,Dillon 2009 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Yountville),"With flavors of buttered toast, vanilla, sweet mango and orange jam flavors, this is as rich, ripe and oaky as they come. Finishing with a honeyed accent, it's made to appeal to consumer's who enjoy the popular style.",Anonymous,
2902,2903,86,Falua 2011 Tagus Creek Shiraz and Trincadeira Red (Tejo),"It seems quite right to call the grape Shiraz rather than Syrah in this blend, because the wine has a ripe, sweetly fruity style reminiscent of Australia. It is broad and full of black fruit, laced with acidity and finished with a warm edge of tannin.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2903,2904,86,Gérard Bertrand 2010 Grenache-Vermentino White (Languedoc),"Aromas of waxy apple skin and white melon rind lead the nose, though a soft lemon oil accent unfolds in the back after the wine warms.

2904,2905,86,Villaggio Grando NV Innominabile Lote IV Red (Santa Catarina),"This is mentholated and spicy, with a brandied cherry note as the dominant aroma.

Made with 90% Lambrusco di Sorbara grapes.",Anonymous,
2907,2908,86,Montes 2010 Alpha Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"On the nose, there are cider, oak and baked corn notes.

2908,2909,86,Pine Ridge 2010 Dijon Clones Chardonnay (Carneros),"The underlying wine here is fine, crisp and minerally, with green apple fruit. Lots of new oak, however, sticks out, in the form of buttered toast and butterscotch.",Anonymous,
2909,2910,86,René Geoffroy NV Rosé de Saignée Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),"This full, rich style of rosé gets its color from grape skins, which provides a touch of tannin as well as strawberry flavor and attractive acidity. It's definitely for food.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2910,2911,86,Spann Vineyards 2009 Two Barrels Petit Verdot (Sonoma County),"Although this is seemingly sweet and a bit one-dimensional, it's tasty, with candied blackberry and plum flavors. Try it with something savory and spicy, like carne asada.",Anonymous,
2911,2912,92,Efeste 2013 Big Papa Old Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is the first vintage of this wine to include estate fruit, along with fruit from Klipsun, Bacchus and Red Willow. A complex medley of herb and spice aromas accented by purple flowers is followed by bold yet still refined dark-fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It has the tannin to go the distance. Best after 2020.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2912,2913,92,Finca la Celia 2013 Heritage Single Vineyard Malbec (Uco Valley),"Prune, raisin and gamy black-fruit aromas fold in a note of iodine. This Uco Valley Malbec features tough but manageable tannins in front of a savory tasting palate with roasted plum and berry flavors. A note of salt lends complexity to a rubbery, tannic finish. Drink through 2023.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2913,2914,92,Boheme 2013 English Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a darkly fruity and spicy wine from a site overlooking the Marin Coastal range, often shrouded in fog.

The oak imprint is light.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2914,2915,92,Brassfield 2013 Volcano Ridge Vineyard Malbec (High Valley),"Concentrated boysenberry and blackberry flavors give this dry and full-bodied wine a lot to like. They melt in the mouth and seem to coat the tongue with a ripeness that's rich but not sweet. Throw in dark chocolate, black currant and a creamy in mouthfeel, and it's an outstanding wine.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2915,2916,92,Michele Chiarlo 2013 Asili  (Barbaresco),"Dark berry, blue flower, brown spice, espresso and balsamic aromas take shape in the glass.

2916,2917,92,Riglos 2013 Gran Malbec (Tupungato),Concentrated aromas of blackberry and iodine are moderately complex.

Drink through 2021.,Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2917,2918,92,Shannon 2013 Reserve Malbec (Lake County),"This full-bodied wine is saturated with ripe and concentrated blackberry and black-grape flavors. A layered and nicely viscous texture clings to the sides of the mouth and holds all that gorgeous fruit through the finish. It's almost all fruit, dark chocolate and a touch of clove, with little obvious oak, for a pure and memorable character.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2918,2919,92,Shannon Ridge 2014 High Elevation Collection Sustainably Farmed Vineyards Petite Sirah (Lake County),"Another good example of how Lake County grows excellent big reds. Delicious, rich, almost chocolaty, this nevertheless dry wine is packed with flavor. It's concentrated, very smooth despite massive tannins and just a pleasure to taste. Tempting now, but best after 2020.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2919,2920,92,Jean Edwards 2013 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Black currant stars in this mountain wine, juicy and brushy in big, pillowy tannin. Still tightly wound, it shows complexity and plenty of natural structure, begging for more time in the bottle to allow for the gunpowder, smoky oak and dark, lush black fruit to marry further. It should show best 2020 through 2023.",Virginie Boone,@vboone

The tannins are substantial, and hint at clean earth. It's big and full through the middle, but tails off a bit in the finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2923,2924,92,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2013 Double Vision Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is an equal split of these two varieties. Aromas of pencil shavings, red and black fruit, wood spice and green herbs are followed by jammy, full-bodied fruit flavors that don't hold back. A lengthy finish caps it off.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2924,2925,92,Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier 2012 L- Block Shiraz (Pyrenees),"This partnership between the Rhône's Michel Chapoutier and his American importer seems remarkably consistent. Peppery clove aromas presage a medium-bodied, silky wine that combines spice with black olives on the midpalate. It's long, finely textured and espresso-tinged on the finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
2925,2926,92,Dr. Loosen 2014 Wehlener Sonnenuhr GG Alte Reben Grosse Lage Dry Riesling (Mosel),"Zesty lime and green melon notes resonate throughout this ethereally light but scintillating dry Riesling. Dusty mineral and pollen notes lend an earthen dimension to crisp, green plum and herb on the palate. It's spine tingling and revitalizing yet lingers persistently on the finish.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
2926,2927,92,Galerie 2015 Naissance Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This gentle, complex white offers lovingly crafted waves of tropical lychee and golden-apple minerality, with bites of wet stone, gravel and lemon. Balanced in acidity and a lightness of being, it's meant for the table or kitchen, to sip happily while making a meal.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2927,2928,92,Andrew Will 2013 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"A blend of Merlot (56%) and Cabernet Franc, this wine opens with aromas of flowers, huckleberry, cardamom and green herbs, along with light barrel accents. The flavors are dense and rich but far from over the top, supported by chewy tannins and a fruit-filled finish that sails into the distance. Best after 2020.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2928,2929,92,Tyrrell's 2011 Vat 1 Semillon (Hunter Valley),"At six years of age, this is just coming into its own. Hints of green fruit remain, tempered by notes of wet stone and toasted marshmallow, harbingers of the full maturity that will arrive in a few years. It's not as lean or edgy as it must've been as a young wine, but is rounding beautifully into form. Drink now–2025.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
2929,2930,92,Xanadu 2015 DJL Chardonnay (Margaret River),"It's good to see this Margaret River stalwart return to the States. The 2015 DJL is a slightly nutty, toasty wine, plump and silky in texture. Pear, melon, vanilla and citrus notes finish long.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
2930,2931,92,Cristom 2015 Estate Pinot Gris (Eola-Amity Hills),"Lovely from the first sniff on, this is packed with mineral-drenched fruit flavors. Pear flesh and skin dominate, along with suggestions of cucumber and white melon. The leesy minerality is a great palate cleanser.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2931,2932,92,Domaine Serene 2013 Jerusalem Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Though labeled simply Willamette Valley, the vineyard is set in the Eola Hills AVA. Complex aromas meld sassafras, Asian spices, baking spices and delicate notes of leaf and stem. The fruit is lightly brambly with an accent on raspberry flavors. The wine is well-proportioned throughout.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2932,2933,92,Domaine Pichot 2015 Le Peu de la Moriette  (Vouvray),"This single vineyard wine has enormous potential. At this stage it is dry and not quite integrated. But with the rich fruitiness, the hints of yellow fruits and the tight mineral character, this wine will age extremely well. Drink from 2021.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2933,2934,92,Quinta de Soalheiro 2015 Reserva Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),"A rich wood-aged wine, this is dense and creamy. With acidity and toast, ripe apples as well as spice, the wine is made to age. Coming from the Alvarinho heartland of Melgaço on Portugal's northern border, the wine has minerality and great intensity. It will be good until at least 2020.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2934,2935,92,Rusack 2014 Estate Reserve Syrah (Ballard Canyon),"Ripe blueberry fruit meets vanilla, cola and thyme touches on the approachable nose of this wine from Steve Gerbac. There's a well-balanced array of flavors on the dynamic palate, from potpourri spice to blackberry and blueberry fruit.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
2935,2936,92,Seven Hills 2014 Pentad Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Carménère, Malbec and Cabernet Franc offers aromas of purple fruit, green herb, clove, barrel spice and spice box. It's light and supple, filling out with palate-coating fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of grip that softens with additional time open. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2936,2937,92,Seven Hills 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Aromas of barrel spice are up front on this locked-up wine, followed by pencil lead, herb, vanilla, black currant and cherry. The palate brings a compelling sense of texture, juxtaposed by aggressive tannins that need a significant amount of time to come into their own. Don't go near it for a decade but it should last well beyond that. Best from 2027–2035.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2937,2938,92,Starmont 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Sourced from the Stanly Ranch Vineyard, among other sites, this 100% varietal wine is light pink-orange in hue, and citrus-driven in flavor. Cherry and strawberry notes complement the lemon and grapefruit, delivering a refreshingly lengthy zip of acidity.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2938,2939,92,Undurraga 2013 Vigno Old Vines Dry-Farmed Red (Maule Valley),"Piercing black cherry and cassis aromas are a touch rustic and massive, but hey, that's old-vines Carignan from Maule (this one also contains 12% Cinsault). So saturated that it's beastly on the palate, this tastes of hard-rolling blackberry and black plum. Plenty of gritty spice, tomato and integrated oak fill out the menu. Drink through 2025.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2939,2940,92,Waxwing 2015 Halcon Vineyard Syrah (Yorkville Highlands),"Great concentration and textural density make this full-bodied and firmly structured wine stand out. Blackberry, black pepper and clove aromas fill the glass while the palate brings out layers of blackberry and dark chocolate notes. With all that structure and flavor, this will be interesting to age a few years. Best after 2021.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2940,2941,92,Whalebone 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"From a vineyard named for the oceanic deposits found there, this bottling offers blackberry syrup, vanilla, clove and black tea aromas. Like the nose, the palate offers a minty lift to its boysenberry and blackberry fruit. It's framed by strong acidity and soft tannins that build after several sips.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
2941,2942,92,Wunsch & Mann 2013 Steingrubler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A touch of lanolin plays alongside dried citrus peel on the nose. The palate has richer rounder notes of dried and fresh pear alongside a lively streak of lemon freshness. This is just on the cusp of evolution and will continue to develop. The depth of lemony fruit is there to sustain it. The finish is long, lasting, lemony and dry.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2942,2943,92,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2013 Saralee's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light and cloudy in the glass, this wine shows a carbonic earthiness that's welcoming and complex. Forest floor, mushroom, pine and cola flavors permeate the palate in a delicately savory way, finishing bright and crisp.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2943,2944,92,Klinker Brick 2014 Old Ghost Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),"While quite ripe and fruity, this wine is also dry, nicely tannic and firmly textured, so it will pair beautifully with rich proteins. Aged 18 months in oak, mostly French, it has concentrated dark fruit aromas, and a layered array of flavors that recalls blueberry, dark chocolate and blackberry syrup. Bright acidity keeps everything in balance.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
2944,2945,92,Kooyong 2015 Estate Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula),"The 2015 vintage in Mornington yielded dark concentrated wines. This one is atypically (for the estate) full bodied and bold as a result, with plum and black-cherry fruit and hints of mint, sage and bay leaf. Long and a bit drying on the finish, it needs a couple of years to come into balance. Drink 2020–2030.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
2945,2946,92,Margerum 2015 D Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Extremely light in color, this top-shelf Sauvignon Blanc from McGinley and Grassini vineyards is compelling on all fronts. Fresh, lively and suave key lime, sliced nectarine and wet sidewalk aromas mark the nose. The palate is tense and nervy, with a grippy texture and energetic acidity that invigorates its crisp citrus and river stone flavors.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
2946,2947,92,Mark Ryan 2014 Crazy Mary Mourvèdre (Red Mountain),"100% varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from Ciel du Cheval and Force Majeure vineyards. The dark fruit, mineral, meat, white pepper, green herb and savory aromas are initially brooding but intriguing. The palate packs a big wallop of dark-fruit flavors, bringing a lot of hedonistic appeal. It's not for the faint of heart but it delivers.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2947,2948,92,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Herrenweg de Turckheim Riesling (Alsace),"A bright dash of lemon is colored with a hint of yeast and flint. The palate, which brims with ripe Amalfi lemon notes, also has that slight flinty stony touch. But it is the lemon that characterizes the compact, precise and dry body. It is the zestiness that brightens and enlivens. Very refreshing, with wonderful balance and tension. Drink now through 2027.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2948,2949,92,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Turckheim Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Both amplitude and generosity are apparent from the first sniff with ripe pear dominating the flavor spectrum. The body is concentrated and balances the full fruit with pleasant tingling zestiness. This is dry and precisely drawn, with a zesty finish.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2949,2950,92,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Turckheim Riesling (Alsace),"Grapefruit and quince make for an exciting opening amidst some yeasty notes. On the palate, aromatic quince and plum notes reflect the generosity of the vintage while remaining dry and light-bodied. There is an ease here, of drinking and thinking, of sipping and being refreshed. This goes down far too easily on deceptively light feet. The finish is of refreshing lemon zest.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2950,2951,92,François Baur 2015 Herrenweg Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Lifted, almost herbal citrus freshness dominates the nose, making for an inviting appetizing opening. The palate comes in with generous ripe pear fruit on a slender body. The flavors are boosted by some residual sweetness. The off-dry finish is of lasting, adorably brilliant, pure pear fruit.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2951,2952,92,Fulcrum 2015 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),"Incredibly suave dark strawberry and cherry aromas meld with chocolate and dusty earth notes on the nose of this bottling from one of the appellation's largest vineyards. The palate is more tightly wound, offering dried thyme, bay leaf and peppercorn instead of opulent fruit.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
2952,2953,92,Gustave Lorentz 2013 Burg Riesling (Alsace),"Fresh notes of ripe lemon zest are suffused with hay flower and earth notes. The palate majors on zesty, lively and aromatic citrus: tangerine and Amalfi lemon above all. This is dry and bright, slender and precise, yet never lets go of its earthy touch. The finish is expansive and clean.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2953,2954,92,Hunnicutt 2014 CUTT Fearless Red (Napa Valley),"This is a blend of 35% Syrah, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Zinfandel and 14% Merlot. It impresses with rich blueberry pie, spicy clove and black pepper flavors while offering a lively experience on the palate that finishes long, with leathery texture and complexity.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2954,2955,92,Work 2013 Lamya's Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"From a site in Calistoga, this wine delivers juicy tobacco, char and black fruit flavors, with a concentrated structure and new French and American oak. Savory leather and black pepper notes close out the long finish.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2955,2956,87,Rutherford Ranch 2013 Rhiannon Red (Napa Valley),"This is a soft, simple, red fruit-driven blend of four Bordeaux varieties, the fruit complemented by a twist of cedar and mint.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2956,2957,87,Tertulia 2012 Phinny Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Brooding aromas of spice box, herb, purple fruit and wood spice are followed by medium-bodied cranberry flavors. The tannins bring a sense of astringency, requiring some time in the cellar to (hopefully?) soften.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2957,2958,87,Tertulia 2016 Elevation Estate Vineyard Marsanne (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Aged in stainless steel, this wine comes from a new wine-growing region in the cataracts of the North fork of the Walla Walla River. The aromas are quite faint initially. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied, with tart flavors. It lacks a sense of clear direction.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2958,2959,87,Thomas Carteron 2016 L'Excellence Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Proudly claiming to be a blend of eight grape varieties, this wine is soft and gently fruity with a spicy background that gives it a bitter edge. That will blow off in a few months, so drink this food friendly wine from late 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2959,2960,87,Tormaresca 2016 Calafuria Negroamaro Rosato (Salento),"Red berry, violet and a whiff of clove lead the nose. Bright and fruity, the refreshing palate doles out crushed raspberry, wild cherry and a savory note of pink peppercorn.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2960,2961,87,Borsao 2013 Berola Red (Campo de Borja),"Aromas of stewed berry fruits and damp leaves lack freshness but are not spoiled. This Garnacha-based blend feels thick and resiny, almost to the point of syrupy. Creamy oaky stewed berry flavors finish with an herbal hint and sticky tannins.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2961,2962,87,Lemelson 2014 Chestnut Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"There's just not much here. The strawberry fruit is wispy thin, the acids tart, the tannins light, and the whole shebang shows only modest depth and grip.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
2962,2963,87,Bertaini 2016 Sereole  (Soave Colli Scaligeri),"This opens with white flower, yellow stone fruit and honeydew melon aromas. The fruity sensations carry over to the palate, with a tangerine zest note and tangy acidity that leads to a juicy finish.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2963,2964,87,Trivento 2016 White Orchid Reserve Torrontés (Mendoza),"Tropical aromas are a tiny bit grassy and oily. In the mouth, this is acidic and tangy, while lime and green-herb flavors are snappy. Crisp citric acidity creates sizzle on a racy finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2964,2965,87,Vionta 2015 Limited Release Albariño (Rías Baixas),"As this enters its second year in bottle, the nose is still clean and punchy, much like fruit salad. A plump solid mouthfeel holds flavors of salty peach. Beyond that, there's not a lot to say about this standard Albariño. Drink immediately.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2965,2966,87,Wilson 2014 Carl's Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Vanilla, cherry and raspberry flavors are complemented by smoky meat and tar in this softly built, mellow and pensively sweet wine that's ripe and generous in body.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
2966,2967,87,Winzerkeller Andau 2016 Blaufränkisch Rosé (Burgenland),"This wine opens with a touch of fleshy ripeness. The palate is expansive, brimming with fresh red berry notes. Light in body, it finishes with uplifting lemon.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
2967,2968,87,Highland Cellars 2015 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),This easygoing off-dry Riesling boasts pretty orange blossom and white-peach perfume. Crisp stone-fruit flavors on the palate are accented by honey and bee pollen. The finish is long and zesty.,Anna Lee C. Iijima,
2968,2969,87,Cantina di Monteforte 2016 Vicario  (Soave Classico),"Spring blossom and white stone fruit aromas delicately set the tone for this wine. On the straightforward palate, fresh acidity underscores ripe pear and yellow apple flavors while a hint of almond signals the close.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2969,2970,87,Cantine Grasso 2015 Caporosso Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"This Nero d'Avola has black-skinned berry, blue flower and black pepper aromas. The easygoing palate conveys mature black cherry and raspberry jam, with round tannins. Enjoy soon.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
2970,2971,87,Cass 2016 Mr. Blanc White (Paso Robles),"This blend of 75% Marsanne and 25% Roussanne is extremely floral, fruity and tropical on the nose, with coconut, mango, guava and tuberose scents. Acidity helps keep that ripeness in check on the palate, but the tropical flavor is powerfully persistent.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
2971,2972,87,Cedar River Cellars 2014 It's a Long Way Barrel Select Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley),"Hailing from Two Blondes Vineyard, the aromas bring unusual, not entirely married notes of ham hock, bacon fat, herb and vanilla. The palate mixes smooth-feeling fruit and savory flavors. It's a unique wine, not for all tastes.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
2972,2973,87,Château Carpe Diem 2016 Castillo Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"A rich blend of Grenache and Cinsault, this is rounded and generous. With ripe strawberry fruit and a full mouthfeel, the wine is packed with berries and light acidity. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2973,2974,87,Château d'Astros 2016 Domaine d'Astros Cuvée Prestige Rosé,"Just north of Saint-Tropez, this large estate has produced a rounded fruity wine. It has a soft crushed strawberry flavor that is balanced by attractive generous acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2974,2975,87,Château Roubine 2016 La Vie en Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"The rose-embossed bottle sets the scene for a soft, perfumed and fruity wine. It has attractive acidity as well as ripe red berries. With its spice and herbal edge, the wine is also textured, a contrast to the fine fruit. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2975,2976,87,Compagnie Viticole de Provence 2016 Domaine Saint Jean le Vieux Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah form a soft warm blend that is ready to drink.

2976,2977,85,Hahn 2010 Nicky Hahn Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Lots of raspberry and cherry fruit in this Pinot Noir. It's sweet and fruity and crisp in acidity, with a sweet coat of vanilla oak. Drink now.",Anonymous,
2977,2978,84,Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2010 Oenodea White (Drama),"This white blend of Malagousia and Moscholfilero starts with aromas of bright citrus, tropical fruit and a hint of musky spice. On the palate, it's a creamy blend of tropical fruit and peach, though slightly clumsy. The wine finishes with a spicy spin.",Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa
2978,2979,84,Hensley 2009 Hillside Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"There's too much of everything in this Cabernet. The fruit is massively extracted and sweetly jammy. The oak is a heavy plaster of sweet caramel. The result is impressive for sheer size, but unbalanced. Unlikely to improve with age.",Anonymous,
2979,2980,84,Maipe 2011 Rosé of Malbec Rosé (Mendoza),"Crisp up front, but not overly aromatic or fruity. Feels kind of thick and chewy, with gummy, sweet berry flavors that suggest cherry and plum. Feels a little cloying and cooked on the finish, especially for a young 2011.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2980,2981,84,McFadden 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (Mendocino),A very minty old vine Zin from organically farmed grapes that tastes of not-quite-ripe strawberry jam and is otherwise smooth and peppery.,Virginie Boone,@vboone
2981,2982,84,Alysian 2009 Westwise Farms Clone 4 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Tastes overworked and sweetly heavy, with super-extracted pineapple jam, orange tapioca and butterscotch flavors. A heavy hand has been applied here.",Anonymous,
2982,2983,84,Carpineto 2010 Valcolomba Vermentino (Maremma),"Valcolomba is a pure expression of Vermentino from Maremma in southern Italy with ripe aromas of melon, peach and passion fruit. The mouthfeel is smooth, easy and creamy soft.",Anonymous,
2983,2984,84,Ksana 2008 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Reedy and green on the nose, then choppy and clipped on the palate. For a full-priced Malbec, this is lacking in ripeness, body and finesse; it's prickly and limited, with green bean, rhubarb and cranberry flavors. Not bad but underwhelming for $33.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2984,2985,84,Morgenhof 2010 Fantail Pinotage Rosé (Stellenbosch),"A pale salmon color, this rosé shows ripe notes of cocoa-dusted cherry and strawberry alongside sweet citrus oil. Creamy and full in the mouth, it's a richer rosé that can stand up to heartier fare.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
2985,2986,83,Gravity Hills 2009 The Sherpa Zinfandel (Central Coast),"This is a simple wine, sharp in acidity and dry, with spicy Zin flavors of berries. Okay with pizza, burgers, barbecue.",Anonymous,
2986,2987,83,Barton & Guestier 2009 Rosé Red (Côtes de Provence),"With some richness, this is a drink-now rosé. The initial fresh fruit has diminished, leaving a rounded, caramel-flavored wine without acidity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
2987,2988,83,Releaf 2009 Made With Organically Grown Grapes Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),"Medium intense aromas of tangerine citrus and crushed yellow flowers transition to flavors of dried grass, red apple and a touch of mushroom powder. Drink now.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
2988,2989,83,Barton & Guestier 2009 Bistro Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays de l'Ile de Beauté),"Unoaked Pinot Noir from Corsica, showing ripe berry flavors, fresh acidity and only light tannins. It's what it says on the label: for casual drinking.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

2990,2991,83,Chilensis 2009 Reserva Chardonnay (Maule Valley),"Tropical notes on the nose are as good as it gets; otherwise it smells like air freshener. In the mouth, it's waxy and flat, with bland apple and vanilla flavors. Finishes pithy.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2991,2992,82,Mazzocco 2008 West Dry Creek Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Shows overripe flavors in the raisins that gives a Port-like taste, and with alcohol well over 16%, it's hot. An inelegant, heavy Zin.",Anonymous,
2992,2993,82,Sorrentino 2008 Natì Coda di Volpe (Pompeiano),"This is an interesting, outright strange wine that opens with a full golden color and an aromatic veil of smoke, dust or chalky mineral over exotic fruit and peach. One item out of place is the alcohol, which emerges strong in the mouth.",Anonymous,
2993,2994,82,Spadafora 2009 Vigna Fiego Rosé (Donnici),"This rosé blend of Magliocco, Greco Nero and Malvasia from Calabria offers lean intensity and aromas of rose petal and small berry. There's a touch of sour almond as well and the wine is slightly bitter and muddled in the mouth.",Anonymous,
2994,2995,82,Chilcas 2009 Single Vineyard Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Generic and monotone on the nose. The palate is nothing more than wet and chunky, while the flavors are soft, sweet and candied, with vanilla and toffee overriding any fruit. A creamy dullard with a lot of vanilla and hardly any pulse.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2995,2996,82,Viu Manent 2010 Secreto de Viu Manent Viognier (Colchagua Valley),"Barely noticeable lime and orange aromas sit mute on the nose, which is reduced and artificial smelling. The palate has a hard feel and generic flavors of white fruits. Amid sweetness there's a chemical bitterness. Not one of this winery's better products.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2996,2997,82,Miguel Torres 2009 Cordillera Reserva Privada Barrel Fermented Chardonnay-Viognier (Chile),"Big and gold, with aromas of corn, sweat and vegetal white fruits. This is soft, dull and rich stuff, with an oaky, dry palate of apricot and papaya.

2997,2998,87,Castillo Clavijo 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),"Toasty, roasted aromas of baked berry and earth head straight to a narrowly built yet weighty palate with earth, plum and raspberry notes. On the finish, this holds onto its plum and raspberry flavors as well as its fresh feel.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
2998,2999,87,Cellars 33 2011 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a lighter-style wine, as Pinots from this vineyard, which is in a warm part of the valley, tend to be. But it's also a tasty Pinot, soft and supple, with cola, cherry jam, brown sugar, pie spice and sandalwood flavors. Drink now.",Anonymous,
2999,3000,87,Del Carlo Winery 2010 Old Vine Home Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This is an old-style, rustic Zin.

3000,3001,87,Joseph Mellot 2012 Le Montarlet  (Sancerre),"One of the more herbaceous Sauvignons in Joseph Mellot's range, this is crisp, leaning to green fruits although with an underlying feeling of ripeness. There is a touch of minerality in the texture, giving the acidity a taut, nervy feeling at the end. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3001,3002,87,Markham 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"This Cab Franc has some nice features, starting with the cherry and herb flavors that finish dry and spicy. It's a bit rough-edged right out of the bottle, but the combination of decanting and drinking it with a rich, fatty steak will improve it tremendously at the table.",Anonymous,
3002,3003,87,Melini 2010 Terrarossa  (Chianti Classico),This straightforward selection offers plum and cherry sensations with hints of espresso and chocolate. The simple style will work well with pasta dishes and cheeses.,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
3003,3004,87,Novy 2010 Garys' Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is tremendous in blackberries, currants and plums, with grilled meat and black pepper notes, and the tannins are rich and profound. Right out of the screwtop, however, there's a tinny, metallic taste that detracts. Your best bet is to decant this fresh young wine and hope it blows off.",Anonymous,
3004,3005,87,Poças 2012 Coroa d'Ouro White (Douro),"This ripe wine is full of apple fruits with a tight streak of citrus acidity. It's a food wine, showing a creamy texture, a light texture and attractive acidity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3005,3006,87,Saget la Perrière 2010 Domaine des Grandes Esperances Les Ailes Pourpres Cabernet Franc (Touraine Amboise),"A cool Cabernet, fresh rather than structured. It's obvious the wine has been worked hard to get out the red fruit flavors and tannins, and it doesn't quite work. It feels extracted with bitterness as well as a more attractive fruitiness.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3006,3007,87,Barone Ricasoli 2011 Brolio  (Chianti Classico),"This young wine offers aromas of underbrush and mushroom, along with evident oak and toasted notes.

3010,3011,87,Ribafreixo 2012 Pato Frio Antão Vaz (Alentejo),"Pato Frio—cold duck—suggests this a summer picnic wine. It certainly has the freshness and crisp elegance. But it also some weight, ripe apple and citrus fruits and a texture that suggests it could age a few months longer.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3011,3012,87,Stoller 2012 Estate Exclusive Riesling (Dundee Hills),"Despite the low alcohol, this is quite dry and tart, with a lemony base and some orange-pekoe flavors also. Not a complex Riesling, but light and pleasantly sippable.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3012,3013,96,Domaine Weinbach 2011 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"This is, quite simply, great Riesling. It has all the subtlety that the grape can produce, as well as a sense of longevity. There's an intensity of fruit—apples and citrus—that cuts through the texture, leaving a beautiful, lingering aftertaste. Still young, drink from 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3013,3014,95,Caldwell 2010 Gold Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Big, rich, and dramatic are just a few words that describe this 100% Cabernet grown on the low-yielding estate vineyard in Coombsville. It's lush with black currants, yet bracing in tannins, with a minerality that makes it feel firm and grounded. The barrels are 100% new French oak, lending a savory level of char and vanilla. This is clearly a wine to cellar for a long time. Start enjoying it in 2018, and it is likely to develop bottle complexity throughout the 2020s.",Anonymous,
3014,3015,95,Joseph Phelps 2011 Quarter Moon Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Credit the cool vintage for this Pinot's mouthwatering acidity. The wine is rich but pristine with fruit, a testament to Phelps' superb viticultural practices and attention to detail at the sorting table. It's dry and crisp, yet rich and delicious, with flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, rosehip tea and cedar. The tannins give the wine a velvety grip. As good as it is now, it would be a shame not to cellar it. Your window of drinkability begins in 2019 and extends for 15 years after.",Anonymous,
3015,3016,95,Domäne Wachau 2012 Achleiten Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"Super-tight and not yet willing to charm, this presently gives little more than the heady spritz of ripe lemon peel, but the stony background, concentration on the palate and a haunting, zesty length all point to future reward. Be patient with this and it will repay you thousandfold, with honeyed richness, luscious peach and a strong mineral backbone. Drink from 2018.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
3016,3017,95,Southard 2010 Whipping Boy Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Alcohol that reaches these levels is often a complexity killer, but not here. This is a stunningly delicious wine, with ripe, powerful and concentrated black fruits. Baking spices, tar, pencil lead, even a whiff of compost all add to the complexity and the depth of flavor is magnificent. This can age at least a decade but is delicious already!",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3017,3018,95,Trimbach 2007 Cuvée Frédéric Emile Riesling (Alsace),"One of Trimbach's top wines, this impressive Riesling, with all its bottle time, is maturing beautifully. It has that petrol character that is typical of aged Riesling, as well as a strong sense of steeliness and intense acidity on the finish. It is probably at its peak now, but will drink well until 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3018,3019,95,Domaine Weinbach 2011 Cuvée Laurence Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Laurence Faller is the family winemaker at Domaine Weinbach, and this wine is a tribute to her skills.

3019,3020,95,Domaines Schlumberger 2009 Kessler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"There is both wonderful bite and density to this great wine. It has a weighty texture full of ripe, rich fruit.

3020,3021,95,Stone The Crows 2011 Three Twins Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"After a great inaugural 2010 vintage, this is another impressive Cabernet from this winery. The vineyard is in the Pritchard Hill area, and the wine is 95% Cabernet with 5% Petit Verdot. It's a lush wine that's rich in black currant, cocoa and plum flavors, enhanced by smoky oak. The wine shows enormous complexity, with layers of minerals and dried herbs that are hard to describe. It has a long life ahead of it, so drink now–2022, at least.",Anonymous,
3021,3022,94,Hunnicutt 2010 9-3-5 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A worthy followup to the splendid 2008 and 2009 vintages, this 100% Cabernet is a blend of grapes from St. Helena, Rutherford and Oakville. It defines Napa Cabernet with lush, intricate and complex favors of blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, milk chocolate and caramelized oak that finish dry and long. The tannins are refined, but thick. This is a wine for the cellar. Start enjoying it after 2017.",Anonymous,
3022,3023,94,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2011 Cuvée Arlette Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Winemaker Kit Singh has tweaked this Right Bank-style blend, but it remains solidly anchored in 49% Merlot and 29% Cabernet Franc, with a small amount of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Tart, young raspberry and pomegranate fruit flavors are set against vividly crisp mineral notes. Tannins are supple and proportionate and the flavors beautifully defined. On the finish, a delightful detail of carpaccio appears.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3023,3024,94,René Muré 2010 Clos Saint-Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"So intense and concentrated, this wine epitomizes the essence of Riesling.

Drink from 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3024,3025,94,Signorello 2010 Padrone Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, grown in the winery's estate vineyard, on the east side of Napa Valley. It's awesomely rich and ripe, delivering heady blackberry, blueberry, cassis liqueur, cola and new oak flavors that are as long in the finish as they are deep. With thick tannins, it's clearly a wine you need to cellar. Drink 2016–2020 and beyond.",Anonymous,

3026,3027,94,Dunham 2009 Lewis Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The 2009 Lewis Merlot is in peak form—a dark, smoky, dare we say 'brooding' wine with generous swatches of cassis, espresso, cacao, licorice and sandalwood. It glides into a silky, seamless, sexy finish, lingering generously for a minute or more.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3027,3028,94,Maison Bleue 2011 La Montagnette Upland Vineyard Grenache (Snipes Mountain),"An expressive, vibrantly pure wine with a complex medley of notes including dark raspberries, wet gravel, crushed flowers and cherry. Aged in five year old French oak barrels, it's vivid and focused with an initial elegance and delicacy that continues to flesh out and evolve over time. Give it some time in the cellar to see it at its best.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
3028,3029,94,Blue Rock 2010 Best Barrels Malbec (Alexander Valley),"This Malbec is lush with flavors of ripe blueberries, blackberry jam, mocha and cassis all wrapped up with toasty oak.

3030,3031,94,Gramercy 2011 The Third Man Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Grenache and Syrah are the mainstays here, with a splash of Mourvèdre completing the Third Man blend. For the first time, Uplands contributes some of the fruit. It's immensely fragrant, fruity, peppery and rich with flavors of strawberry, raspberry, cherry and plum. There is nothing simple here; scents and flavors compound and linger, and the more you look, the more you find.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3031,3032,94,Krutzler 2011 Perwolff Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"The combination of just-ripe cherry fruit and fresh blackberries with bracing acidity distinguishes this clean-cut red.

3032,3033,94,Domaine Tempier 2011 La Tourtine Red (Bandol),"The initial impression of this wine is lean and austere.

3033,3034,94,Domaines Schlumberger 2010 Saering Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"This is a perfumed, complex wine that veers between showcasing the freshest fruit flavors and hints of maturity. It's fresh with berry notes and intense with acidity, but rich in texture as well. This is a wine to age much longer, so don't drink before 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3034,3035,94,Domäne Wachau 2012 Kellerberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"This wine boasts a creamy palate, with aromas of fresh and baked apples that transition to flavors of apple crumble laced with citrus zest.

3035,3036,94,René Muré 2007 Clos Saint Landelain Vorbourg Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Although certainly sweet, this wine is much more than that.

Drink now and until 2020.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3036,3037,94,Sante Arcangeli 2012 Split Rail Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"With a pale color and mouthwatering acidity, this delicately structured Pinot goes well beyond its immediate flavors of raspberry tea, pomegranates, persimmons, orange peel, exotic spices and oak to offer a Burgundian touch of earth and mushrooms. There's also a firm, stony minerality on the palate. This gorgeous Pinot was produced in tiny quantities of 300 cases and will drink well over the next six years.",Anonymous,
3037,3038,94,Owen Roe 2011 Red Willow Vineyard Chapel Block Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Sourced from what is arguably Red Willow's finest block of Syrah, this is superbly balanced and remarkably concentrated for this cool site from a cool vintage.

3038,3039,90,Armida 2014 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Caramel apple and honeyed, biscuity notes combine, layering richness upon richness in this single vineyard wine.

3039,3040,90,Brooks 2014 La Chenaie Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Just three barrels were made of this rather unusual wine. It's a seemingly disparate mix of raspberries, gun metal, dried seaweed and carpaccio, yet somehow it all comes together. The length is impressive. This is one of those wines that will thrill some tasters and puzzle others.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3040,3041,90,Viñedos de Paganos 2013 La Nieta  (Rioja),"Typically dark in color, with plum, blackberry and a touch of raisin on the nose, this feels a bit jammy, with a shock of acidity and hard tannins.

3044,3045,90,Hugel 2014 Cuvée Les Amours Pinot Blanc (Alsace),Crisp notes of freshly peeled pear mingle with a creamier aspect on the nose.

3046,3047,90,Otazu 2006 Altar Red (Navarra),"Cool rooty aromas of cola and tree bark grace the nose on this ripe but still not fully mature Cabernet Sauvignon (with 5% Merlot). In the mouth, this is choppy due to sandpaper tannins. Flavors of sarsaparilla, pepper, and blackberry are dense and chewy, while the finish is bumpy and scraping due to aforementioned hard tannins. Drink or hold through 2022.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
3047,3048,90,Príncipe de Viana 2013 Edición Limitada Red (Navarra),"Aromas of cherry, plum, forest floor and tobacco feed into a clampy palate with fresh acidity.

3048,3049,90,Jim Barry 2014 The Lodge Hill Shiraz (Clare Valley),"This juicy, medium-bodied Shiraz is filled with mouthwatering cherry-berry fruit.

3049,3050,90,Katnook Estate 2014 Founder's Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra),"It's been some time since Katnook last submitted samples, so it's reassuring to see that quality there remains high.

3051,3052,90,Comenge 2011 Familia Comenge Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Earthy and a touch gritty smelling on first take, this gets riper, cleaner and better the longer it catches air. A full slightly tannic palate is mildly abrasive, while tea, herbal berry and chocolaty oak flavors are appealing. A spicy peppery chocolaty finish is not shedding its drying tannins. Drink through 2022.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
3052,3053,90,CVNE 2010 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"For a tight, snappy rendition of Rioja, this answers the call. Herbal plum and tomato aromas are earthy and a touch horsey.

3056,3057,90,Avignonesi 2012 Grandi Annate  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Ripe plum, coconut, vanilla and French oak aromas lead the nose. Youthfully assertive and austere, the palate offers toasted oak, licorice and espresso notes, set against a backdrop of bracing tannins that grip the finish.

3057,3058,90,Boeckel 2014 Zotzenberg Grand Cru Sylvaner (Alsace),This is from Alsace's only Grand Cru vineyard for the Sylvaner grape.

3062,3063,93,Proidl 2015 Hochäcker Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),"Fresh citrus has a tang of green apple on the nose. The palate colors this with an equally zesty dollop of grapefruit, but something riper, richer, almost of dried fruit, also swings in there. This is intriguing and fresh, zesty and taut, lip-smacking and moreish. I feel that this will give up its secrets with a little more bottle age, but it already is delicious now.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
3063,3064,93,Small Vines 2014 Baranoff Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From a vineyard planted in rocky red soil, this wine shows a depth of concentrated and intense cranberry and black tea.

3065,3066,93,Johanneshof Reinisch 2014 Frauenfeld St. Laurent (Thermenregion),"Something floral and soft hovers above the fruit. There also is the rich hazel presence of fine oak. The fruit is beautifully luminous: very aromatic red cherry is drenched in the soft vanilla of oak. The tannins are silky but dense.

3072,3073,93,Allram 2015 Gaisberg Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"The very gentle but seductive notion of sun-ripened red-cheeked mirabelle plums radiates like sunshine from the glass. With a further sniff there also is peppery greenery: yarrow and hay.

3412,3413,86,Château des Charmes 2009 St. David's Bench Vineyard Chardonnay (St. David's Bench),"Aromas of fresh figs, strawberries and dark flowers add mystery and unusual dimension to this wine. Tangy on the palate, with notes of underripe stonefruit and vibrant lime-inflected acidity, it's a refreshingly different wine that would complement a variety of fowl or creamy cheeses.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
3413,3414,86,Van Loveren 2011 Chenin No. 5 Chenin Blanc (Robertson),"A refreshing and approachable wine, with forward notes of green plum, plantain, Granny Smith apple and lime on the nose and palate. There's a slight roundness to the midpalate, but a vibrant twang lifts the finish.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
3414,3415,86,D'Arenberg 2008 The Coppermine Road Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),"There's a slightly scorched character to this wine that I had a tough time getting past. There's solid plummy fruit, but also recurring hints of freshly sawn lumber and burnt coffee. It's full bodied, with plenty of astringent tannins, so it might age past this current stage, and it's possible this rating could look stingy in a few years.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
3415,3416,86,Domaine Courtois 2010 La Source Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah doesn't have the most effusive red-cherry fruit, but instead shows an appealing earthy, savory side. Pepper, clove and some dusty earth elements impart complexity above its price point. Drink now.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
3416,3417,85,Barrel Oak 2009 Reserve Chardonnay (Virginia),"Scents of roasted nuts and apples gain levity on the palate with flavors of lemons and delicate white flowers. Richly textured, this has a slightly-viscous but refreshingly-fruity profile.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
3417,3418,85,Ferré I Catasús NV Mas Suau Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava),"This is a bit wayward and cheesy on the nose, but on the palate it's good and smooth.

3418,3419,85,Pardas 2010 Rupestris White (Penedès),"A bit oily on the bouquet, this has slightly acrid notes of burnt hay and matchstick, with notes of apple and nectarine. It feels full and not edgy, with good acidity and limited flavors of baked apple and peach. A standard Penedès wine made from 80% Xarello, with Malvasia and Macabeo.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

3429,3430,88,HandCraft 2014 Artisan Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This admittedly oaky wine makes an attractive package of cedary, savory aromas and rich fruit flavors.

3430,3431,88,Ironstone 2013 Reserve Kramer Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Sierra Foothills),"Mint and sage hints in this wine's aroma give way to powerful oak and dark fruit flavors on the palate.

3435,3436,88,Enoport 2015 Tonel 22 Red (Douro),"This bold, firm wine strikes a fine balance between structure and ripe black plum fruit. It has dense tannins that indicate it needs time. A blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Franca, it will be ready from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

3439,3440,88,Georges Vigouroux 2015 Atrium Malbec (Cahors),"While there are plenty of tannins in this wine, there is also great fruit. Blackberry and plum flavors explode in the mouth. They are backed by the serious tannins and dark texture that will allow the wine to age. Drink this bold wine from 2019.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3440,3441,88,Clos Pegase 2013 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine consists of all five red Bordeaux varieties plus 5% Syrah.

3443,3444,88,Von Schleinitz 2015 KonSECCO Riesling Sparkling (Mosel),"Savory, caramelized toast and nut tones accentuate zippy apple and lemon flavors in this flirty, Prosecco-style Riesling. Ripe and forward, it's softer and easier in its approach than traditional Riesling Sekt. Enjoy through 2020.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
3444,3445,87,Rutherford Hill 2000 26th Anniversary Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Hits all the right notes, from the rich, sweet tropical fruit to the butter and toast accents, but like the third violin in the symphony, lacks that extra flair to really stand out. The oak is well proportioned, and some zesty lime notes that should make it reasonably versatile with food grace the finish. —J.C.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
3445,3446,87,Rutz 1999 Maison Grand Cru Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a blend of Rutz's single-vineyard Pinots. Displays the fleshy, berry and tomato flavors of Dutton Ranch and Martinelli, and is very similar to both. Makes the case for blending. It doesn't hit the heights, but is a refined wine, and a versatile one. —S.H.",Anonymous,
3446,3447,87,Wirra Wirra 2000 Scrubby Rise Red (Fleurieu Peninsula),"This easy-to-drink blend of 50% Shiraz, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot starts off jammy, with black cherry liqueur and clove notes before settling down and developing some interesting peach and mocha nuances.

3447,3448,87,Thunder Mountain 1999 Ciardella Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Tight and sulky right now, showing little more than earth and minerals on the nose. Later, it opens up to reveal apple and pear fruit along with some oily flavors. Finishes with citrus and green apple. Hang out the “Do Not Disturb” sign; this crisp, flavorful Chard could use another year or two of cellaring.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
3448,3449,87,Ste. Chapelle 2000 Value Series Merlot (Idaho),"Idaho and Merlot are not thoughts that generally spring together in the mind of the wine consumer, but Ste.

3449,3450,87,Valdegracia 1998 Tinto Crianza Tempranillo (Ribera del Guadiana),"Even and light, but with copious tart cherry aromas and flavors, this tasty red comes from rugged Extremedura, in southwestern Spain, near Portugal. Saddle leather accents add interest, and the tangy finish closes with balanced tannins that'll cut through food well. Drink now–2005. —M.M.",Anonymous,
3450,3451,87,Hyatt 2000 Reserve Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"The reserve is not particularly oaky; rather it puts the emphasis on straightforward, well-rendered green apple fruit flavors, augmented with some balanced flavors of licorice and vanilla.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3451,3452,87,Rosemount 2001 Diamond Label Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),"Filled with bright, bouncy cherry-berry fruit and imbued with a slightly viscous mouthfeel, this fun, gulpable Shiraz won't break the bank. Its easygoing nature makes it worth having on hand for your next barbecue. —J.C.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
3452,3453,87,McIlroy 1999 Aquarius Ranch Merlot (Russian River Valley),"A wine that elicits mixed feelings. On the plus side, subtle fruit and oak, with a rich earthiness and sleek tannins. Does a good job of keeping Merlot fat and plump, while maintaining an herbal character. On the other hand, there's pronounced acidity and a sharpness that shows up on the finish. Doesn't seem likely to age well, but you never know. —S.H.",Anonymous,
3453,3454,87,Raymond 2000 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"It's all about extract in this kick-in-the-pants Chard. Assaults the palate with oversized fruit and the sting of peppery spice. Words like bright, electric and bold come to mind. It's also sweet and oaky. —S.H.",Anonymous,
3454,3455,87,Ventana 1999 Reserve Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and lees aging add buttery, creamy, spicy complexities to this clean, steely wine. The underlying fruity flavors are not intense and veer toward leaner citrus and green apple flavors. It's a focused wine, not overblown. —S.H.",Anonymous,
3455,3456,87,Sapphire Hill 2000 Winberrie Old Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"An herbal, not to say earthy, wine with sage and oregano aromas and flavors. Dry and supple, it's softened by a hint of cherry cola in the finish, and will wake up with rich barbecue. —S.H.",Anonymous,
3456,3457,87,Kiona 2000 Dry White Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Scents of lemon wax and a slightly spritzy mouthfeel are followed by somewhat surprisingly sweet fruit for a wine labeled dry.

3457,3458,87,Gallo of Sonoma 1999 Laguna Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Seems somewhat crisper and less weighty than prior vintages, with the custardy mouthfeel buttressed by lemony acids. You'll also find apples, sweet plums and the obligatory toast and vanilla. —J.C.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
3458,3459,93,Sheridan Vineyard 2004 Reserve Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This is just 14.2% alcohol, so despite the richness and ripeness, this is not fat or flabby. The fruit has concentrated black cherry and cassis flavors, and the smoky, pain grillé flavors of barrel aging are nicely integrated. Aromatically this wine is just beginning to evolve, with complex plum, prune, cherry liqueur, coffee and smoke.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3459,3460,93,Suacci Carciere Wines 2006 Suacci Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a new brand and a very good introductory Pinot Noir. In its light, silky mouthfeel and deep, complex flavors, it showcases its Russian River origins in a classic way. Offers up brilliantly ripe flavors of red currants, licorice, cola, gingerbread, mocha and spices, wrapped into a dry, balanced structure. Best now for its youthful charm.",Anonymous,
3460,3461,93,Keenan 2005 Reserve Mailbox Vineyard Merlot (Spring Mountain District),"This bottling has turned out to be one of California's more important Merlot releases. The '05, like its immediate predecessors, is a dry, richly tannic wine of great elegance and structural complexity. It pleases now for the wealth of black currants, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak, and should develop bottle nuances through 2011.",Anonymous,
3461,3462,93,Xavier Monnot 2006 Les Folatières Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"A beautifully shaped wine that exudes richness balanced with lively fresh fruits.

Delicious.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3462,3463,92,Fielding Hills 2006 RiverBend Vineyard Tribute Red Red (Wahluke Slope),"Tribute is 41% Syrah, 30% Merlot and 27% Cabernet Sauvignon, all estate-grown. The bouquet opens immediately into a fascinating complexity. What wafts up from the glass is a heady mix of incense, smoke, jam, toast, iron and herb—you can spend a pleasant 10 or 15 minutes just counting all the threads. Spicy, loaded with raspberry and strawberry fruit, gentle acids and silky tannins, this glides comfortably into a tangy finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3463,3464,92,Brosseau 2006 Cuvee Kilene Brosseau Vineyard Syrah (Chalone),"Brosseau scored with this bottling last year, and the '06 is as good, showing the same classy elegance. It's drily tannic, but enormously rich in currants, with complexities of smoky leather, tobacco, olive tapenade and tamari-sauteed wild mushrooms. Delicious now, and should develop bottle complexities through 2012.",Anonymous,
3464,3465,92,Byron 2006 Nielson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A lovely, complex Pinot that shows much of the flair of Byron's more expensive bottlings.

3465,3466,92,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Clos Saint-Jean Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"Ripe and soft, here is a Chanson white that hasn't been overwhelmed by wood.

3466,3467,92,La Chablisienne 2006 Vaulorent Premier Cru  (Chablis),"A premier cru that could almost be grand cru in quality terms, this is a big, ripe wine, the powerful yellow and green plum flavors spiced with some wood aging. There's a great, full-bodied explosion of fruit in the mouth, but the mineral edge of the wine suggests aging potential, perhaps even more  ageable than the 2005 vintage.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3467,3468,92,Lionheart 2007 Saralee's Vineyard The Angel's Share Marsanne-Roussanne White (Russian River Valley),"A distinctive wine.

3468,3469,92,Sheridan Vineyard 2004 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"This is 100% new oak (primarily Taransaud, 32 months), and it's a marvelous example of the grape, the vineyard and the strengths of Washington fruit. The Shafer Hillside Select is the inspiration for the extended barrel aging and the focus on round, sweet tannins. This is a tight wine, with a lovely purity of fruit that captures the cassis, the black cherry, the subtle herbal character of the Cabernet grape. This is from the oldest block in the vineyard—now eight -year-old vines.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3469,3470,92,Silverado 2005 SOLO Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Here's a complex, layered wine that impresses for sheer power. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of black currants, blackberries, black cherries, dark chocolate, anise and cedar that finish deep and long. Delicious and dry, but quite closed now in tannins, and needs time. Best after 2009, at least.",Anonymous,
3470,3471,92,Simonnet-Febvre 2006 Montée de Tonnerre Premier Cru  (Chablis),"New wood and yellow fruit aromas give an exotic spice- and caramel-flavored wine.

3471,3472,92,Soos Creek 2006 Artist Series #6 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The vineyard sources for this Bordeaux-style blend—Champoux, Ciel du Cheval, Weinbau and Dineen—are impeccable, and represent four of the best AVAs in Washington. It's almost exactly half and half Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and smells like beautifully ripe blackberries, boysenberries and cassis. It sets up in the mouth firm and textural, and adds layers of chocolate and baking spices as it winds through the finish. Not a soft wine, but more open and accessible than most vintages of Soos Creek.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3472,3473,92,Soos Creek 2006 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon; the only other grape in the blend is a 14% Cab Franc component. Rich black cherry fruit provides the solid base, but after that the wine tightens down, so decanting would be essential if you plan to drink it soon. The scents weave together black fruits, spices and licorice; more than any of the other new releases from Soos Creek, this needs more time to settle.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3473,3474,92,Stuhlmuller Vineyards 2007 Estate Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"The best Chardonnays from this warm Sonoma County valley show tropical fruit flavors and are quite decadent, and this is one of the best.

3475,3476,92,Fielding Hills 2006 RiverBend Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"This blend is 82% Cabernet Franc, 6% Syrah, 6% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Sauvignon.

The match of acid and barrel flavored tannins is picture perfect.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

3478,3479,92,Harrington 2006 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, just explodes with cherry jam, crushed black raspberries and sweet toasted oak and vanilla flavors.

3480,3481,92,Byron 2006 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Very rich, very complicated, a young, dense, grapey wine that clearly needs time to come around. Dry and balanced in acids and tannins, it shows brilliantly ripe blackberry, black cherry and cola flavors, with an earthy note the Brits used to call beetroot. Give it until after 2009 to begin to mellow.",Anonymous,
3481,3482,92,Cantine Gini 2000 Messere Red (Toscana),"Here's a definite “wow!” wine with soft texture, dense extraction and a generous bouquet of ripe cherry flavors.

3482,3483,92,Olivier Leflaive 2006 Vaudésir Grand Cru  (Chablis),"A tight, vivid wine that expresses pure Chardonnay with a steely eye.

3488,3489,90,Ca' del Baio 2009 Valgrande  (Barbaresco),"Sometimes Nebbiolo, depending on the ripeness of the fruit at harvest time, trades in its characteristic austerity for softer tones of ripe fruit and dried currant.

3576,3577,88,Domaine Charles Baur 2012 Cuvée Charles Riesling (Alsace),"This balanced wine is crisp, taut and mineral. It tastes very dry, packed with acidity and perfumed apple and lemon flavors. It's quite ready to drink, but will be better from 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3577,3578,88,Domaine Jean Sipp 2012 Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace),"With good concentration, this still-young Riesling has potential. It's aromatic, with hedgerow aromas, summer fruits and bright acidity. There is a juicy background along with a more textured character that is ready for that aging. Drink from 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3578,3579,88,Dunstan 2013 Durell Vineyard Rosé (Sonoma Coast),"The only rosé made from Durell Vineyard, this one employs 100% Pinot Noir for a subtle, light, dry wine that's refreshing in strawberry and peach. Having spent six months in neutral French oak, it's structured and midweight, just right for the table.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
3579,3580,88,René Muré 2012 Cuvée V Pinot Noir (Alsace),"This soft and ripe wine is full of bright cherry flavors, with gentle tannins and just a hint of wood aging. A proper Pinot Noir acidity brings out the fruitiness of the wine. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3580,3581,88,Apex 2012 The Catalyst Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A little over half Syrah with a balance of Merlot, barrel fermented in French and American oak—20% new—it shows notes of clove, dusty spice, and blackberry. The palate is medium bodied and flavorful with slightly astringent tannins with tart cherry and cranberry notes on the finish.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
3581,3582,88,Santa Alicia 2012 Gran Reserva de Los Andes Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Red berry and herbal aromas are firm and focused on the nose.

3582,3583,88,Sparkman 2013 Pearl Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An unusual version of Pearl, this includes 9% Grenache Blanc and 5% Roussanne in the blend. Though it's labeled Sauvignon Blanc, those other grapes seem to command center stage, and the wine might as well be thought of as a creative white blend rather than a single variety. Pungent and herbal, it has well-knit and balanced green and yellow fruit flavors, with notes of caraway seed and grass.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3583,3584,94,J. Rochioli 2011 Sweetwater Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The Sweetwater block is the highest on the Rochioli estate, stretching into the hills. The wine is very concentrated in green apples, spicy Asian pears and insanely ripe summer peaches. It's quite oaky, with strong buttered toast notes, yet the oak is balanced with the fruit. A classy, flashy wine that drinks well now, and should develop in the bottle over the next 4–6 years.",Anonymous,
3584,3585,94,Domaine de la Mordorée 2010 La Reine des Bois Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"The Delorme family's luxury cuvée is aged in a fair bit of small oak, which imparts a plush texture and cedary overtones to the wine.

3585,3586,94,Domaine Isabel Ferrando 2010 Colombis Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Despite being aged in used barrels, this does show some oaky notes, but they're well balanced by bushels of black cherry fruit. It's lush, creamy and harmonious, with a long finish and up to 10 years of longevity.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
3586,3587,94,François Bertheau 2011 Les Amoureuses  (Chambolle-Musigny),"This wine has great fruitiness, soft tannins and generous, ripe red fruits, while finishing dry. It's a wine with the structure for aging while also packed with big red fruits. Keep for 4–6 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3587,3588,94,Blackbird Vineyards 2010 Illustration Red (Napa Valley),"There's something enormously satisfying about this Merlot-based blend. It hits the Napa-Bordeaux sweet spot, with concentrated blackberry and cherry fruit, jacketed in sweet, smoky oak. But there's also a fascinating olive character. The tannins are rich and dense and velvety. Great to experience now, and should be one for the long haul, perhaps through 2022.",Anonymous,
3588,3589,94,Château de la Font du Loup 2010 Le Puy Rolland Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"This 100% Grenache cuvée displays charming and complex aromas of garrigue and ripe cherries and raspberries.

3589,3590,94,Lynmar 2011 Freestone Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Richness floods the midpalate with flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants and cola, brightened with crisp, zesty acidity. This is Lynmar's best Freestone Pinot ever, showing the ability of the vineyard to ripen fruit even in a chilly vintage. Exciting and stimulating, it's a wine you want to age for at least six years.",Anonymous,
3590,3591,94,Communication Block 2010 Lampyridae Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Serious cellar Cabernet here. It's eruptive with jammy, blackberries, cherries and black currants, with a delicious edge of dark chocolate. The new oak adds spicy, pungent notes of buttered toast and caramel. Yet it's also very tannic. So balanced and finessed, this Cab should have no trouble negotiating the next 10-plus years. Maybe longer. Much longer.",Anonymous,
3591,3592,94,Domaine des Croix 2011 Bressandes Premier Cru  (Beaune),"A fine, mineral, structured wine with a very dry, solid core. Juicy red fruits offer a hint for its future ripeness. It has the freshness of the vintage that shows through at the end of this chunky wine. Age for 5–7 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3592,3593,88,Gustave Lorentz 2010 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Soft and attractively spicy, this has flavors of fresh apple, exotic mango and kiwi. Along with this fruitiness is a perfumed character that rounds out the finish. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3593,3594,88,Agate Ridge 2009 Estate Syrah (Rogue Valley),"This is arguably the best of the current Agate Ridge reds. It's a nicely focused Syrah, mixing flavors of raspberry, chocolate and coffee syrup into a ripe bundle. The tannins are supportive and proportionate.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

3595,3596,88,Bodega Cuarto Dominio 2010 Chento Vineyard Selection Malbec (Mendoza),"A very good, heavily oaked Malbec that exudes clove and hickory notes before settling on aromas of earthy fruit and cheesy leather. The palate feels flush and tannic, with accents of clove and cumin and a secondary berry flavor. It ends with touches of barrel spice and resin.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
3596,3597,88,Bortolotti NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"A tiny percentage of Chardonnay is added to this Prosecco Superiore, giving it a small boost in terms of structure and creaminess. That addition adds a scent of fresh fruit, with subtle hints of apricot and exotic spice.",Anonymous,
3597,3598,88,Cave de Beblenheim 2010 Baron de Hoen Riesling (Alsace),"Full and fruity, this is already a delicious wine. A note of tangy citrus enlivens the apple and pear flavors. This has weight and an intense texture, with warm acidity and a touch of spice on the finish.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3598,3599,88,Willm 2009 Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"This is already mature. It has weight and demonstrates a delicious balance between a ripe white-fruit flavor and fresh acidity, with a fine note of tangy citrus. Ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3599,3600,88,Keever 2009 Inspirado Red (Napa Valley),"Very ripe and fruity, this has a rich, glycerine-driven sweetness, like a tangy ruby Port. It's delicious in blackberry jam and caramel flavors, with intricate tannins and fine, citrusy acids.",Anonymous,
3600,3601,88,Labouré-Roi 2009 Le Taillefer  (Pommard),"The wine has firm, dark tannins as befits a Pommard, with underlying sumptuous black fruit. As the tannins soften, this will become a rich and juicy wine, and it will likely always remain structured.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3601,3602,88,Malibràn 2010 5 Grammi Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"A unique fruit aroma is highlighted with notes  of almond, yellow rose and cracked white pepper. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft thanks to the frothy mousse.",Anonymous,
3602,3603,88,Malibràn 2011 Millesimato Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"This has very nice aromatic intensity, boasting layers of peach blossom, jasmine and honey. Sweet peach tones appear on the close and are enhanced by the wine's creamy texture.",Anonymous,
3603,3604,88,Mount Veeder 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Tough and gritty in tannins, this Cabernet is still raw. There's a flattering core of ripe blackberry and black currant fruits, but the wine doesn't show the approachability of other 2007 Cabernets. Give it another five years in the cellar, but no guarantees that the fruit will outlast the tannins.",Anonymous,
3604,3605,88,Olson Ogden 2009 Margaret's Mandate Marsanne (Napa Valley),"This full-bodied version—sourced from Napa Valley's famed Stagecoach Vineyard—tastes very much like a barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc, with honey and green apple flavors.

3608,3609,88,Easton 2009 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Pungent of baked plum and baking spice, this Shenandoah Barbera is soft and rustic, yet refined, with a jolt of mocha espresso on the finish. The expert acidity enveloping this wine should pair with Mediterrean-themed food.",Virginie Boone,@vboone

3610,3611,88,Ruggeri & C. NV Santo Stefano Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"This offers a bright and intense bouquet of white flower, peach blossom, almond paste and orange zest. A pretty sensation of sweetness gives it a round, creamy feel on the finish.",Anonymous,
3611,3612,88,Terrazas de Los Andes 2011 Reserva Torrontés (Salta),"A consistent Torrontés, with tropical and exotic aromas of green melon, lychee and bath oil.

3613,3614,92,Turnbull 2008 Fortuna Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Scores high on the deliciousness factor, with waves of blackberries, blueberries, currants, dark chocolate and smoky oak. A little on the soft side, which might limit ageability, but it sure is opulent.",Anonymous,
3614,3615,92,MacPhail 2009 Wildcat Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Tastes thick, heavy and sweet in youth, showing the fantastic ripeness of the vintage, with a flavor of cherry and raspberry marmalade. Oak shows up in the rich addition of buttered cinnamon toast. If that sounds good, it is, and you can enjoy it now. But it will improve with 3–4 years in the bottle.",Anonymous,
3615,3616,92,Matrix 2009 Reserve Nunes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Deeply flavored in raspberries, cherries, red licorice and exotic dusty spices, this Pinot Noir has a tannin-acid tightness that makes it aloof and hard. Although it's dry, it's so rich in fruit, it tastes sweet. A very fine wine, but needs some time to come around. Give it four or five years to mellow.",Anonymous,
3616,3617,92,Vista Hills 2009 Marylhurst Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A standout Pinot, expressive from the first sniff to the last swallow. Elegant and precise, with deep notes of black cherry fruit, set into a balanced framework of tannin and acid. Barrel notes of coffee and cinnamon are expressive and beautifully integrated.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3617,3618,92,Williams Selyem 2009 Drake Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A big, rich, flashy Chardonnay that's designed to impress, and does. Almost too much of a good thing, with massive lemondrop candy, pineapple, lime and kiwi fruit flavors, as well as firm minerality and lots of toasty oak. Drink now with opulent fare, such as shellfish.",Anonymous,
3618,3619,92,Zuccardi 2008 Zeta Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Powerful, pure and tightly wound, meaning it's a candidate for short-term cellaring, say 2–5 years. Smells ripe and fruity, with blackberry, cola and coconut resulting in a spot-on nose. Concentrated and juicy, with a strong constitution and potent plum, berry and cassis flavors. Toasty and lightly oaky on the finish; 73% Malbec and 27% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
3619,3620,92,Jean-Luc Baldès 2009 Château Labrande Malbec (Cahors),"This is a serious, firmly structured wine, impressively rich as well as tannic. Black fruits push through the considerable structure, offering balance as the wine ages. It is young now, with hints of mint from wood aging. Powerfully textured, give this 4–5 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3620,3621,92,Joh. Jos. Prüm 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Are the '09 auslesen from Manfred Prüm just in a dull phase? This wine still impresses for its scents of crushed stone and latent power, but the peach, melon and citrus notes fall a little short of expectations for this venerated estate. Give it 10 years or more to come around.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
3621,3622,92,Stuhlmuller Vineyards 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Stuhlmuller's regular 2008 Cabernet, released a year ago, was quite good. This one's even better. It has all the hallmarks of a superior Cabernet, with rich, delicious blackberry, cherry, licorice, Dr. Pepper cola and oak flavors, framed into soft, intricate tannins. With a pleasant minerality, it should age well through 2016, gradually losing fruit.",Anonymous,
3622,3623,92,Bodega Catena Zapata 2009 White Stones Adrianna Vineyard Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Without doubt the most full and complete Chardonnay from Argentina that this critic has tried. It smells lush and toasty, with elegant apple and pear aromas. The mouthfeel is rich and balanced, while flavors of baked apple, vanilla cream and woodspice are endearing. Long and flavorful on the finish, and not overoaked. A serious Chardonnay to drink now.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
3623,3624,92,Bründlmayer 2010 Alte Reben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Old vines give an extra concentration in this intensely spice- and green plum-flavored wine.

3624,3625,92,Château d'Aydie 2009 Madiran Laplace Tannat (Madiran),"With the richness of the vintage, the natural tannins of Tannat are tamed by the welter of intense black fruits, sweet berries and Arabica coffee. The structure is exhibited in the dusty tannins under all the fruit.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3625,3626,92,Corvalle 2010 Weka Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District),"Quite an interesting Chardonnay, in an era when so many are too sweet and extracted. There's plenty of orange and apricot fruit flavor, but also a brilliant streak of minerality, like a lick of cold steel, and the overall taste is dry. Really easy to like, with lots of complexity to warrant repeated sipping.",Anonymous,
3626,3627,92,Broman 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Tart now, with lots of acidity cutting across the blackberry and mineral flavors. As rich as it is, there's a taut elegance that makes the wine tense. Clearly too young, it should develop fine bottle complexity over this decade.",Anonymous,
3627,3628,92,Château Peyros 2007 Vieilles Vignes Tannat (Madiran),"A powerful wine, very concentrated, the tannins a part of the richer fruit and dark brooding character of the wine. There is good juiciness as well, black fruits and acidity cutting through the dominant young tannins.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3628,3629,92,Davies 2009 Ferrington Vineyards Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Richness marks this flamboyantly fruity, sweet young Pinot Noir. It erupts in jammy cherry and raspberry flavors, while new oak brings sweet, toasty complications of smoky butter and vanilla. Would be just an ordinary fruit bomb except for the wonderful acid-tannin structure. So delicious.",Anonymous,
3629,3630,92,Domaine Rotier 2008 Renaissance Doux Loin de l'Oeil (Gaillac Doux),"The Loin de l'Oeil is the local white grape of Gaillac and is very happy to produce sweet botrytized wines.

3633,3634,91,Elena Walch 2008 Castel Ringberg Riserva Chardonnay (Alto Adige),"This gorgeous Riserva Chardonnay shows modern oak touches of vanilla and toasted almond backed by apricot, honeysuckle and creamy lemon mousse. It's a thick, structured white wine with a creamy finish that would pair with chicken, shellfish or pork.",Anonymous,
3634,3635,87,Frisk 2015 Prickly Riesling (Alpine Valleys),"Prickly refers to the wine's texture, which is definitely lightly frizzante (spritzy).

Drink now.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
3635,3636,87,Calcu 2016 Reserva Especial Rosé (Colchagua Valley),"Raspberry, bubble gum and rhubarb aromas get this pink-tinted rosé off to a solid start.

3636,3637,87,Capolino Perlingieri 2015 Vento Greco (Sannio),"This opens with subtle aromas evoking yellow pear, Mediterranean brush and a rather unusual whiff suggesting warm hay.

3637,3638,87,Charlier & Fils NV Rosé de Saignée Prestige Brut  (Champagne),"Because its color comes from the grape skins rather than from the addition of red wine, this is a dark-hued rosé Champagne. It has a tannic edge that will soften with bottle age, allowing its red berry fruit to show better, so drink from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3638,3639,87,Columbia Crest 2015 Reserve Chenin Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills),"Light aromas of white peach and flowers are followed by elegantly styled, off-dry stone-fruit flavors. It provides intrigue but doesn't entirely deliver.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
3639,3640,87,Concha y Toro 2015 Marques de Casa Concha Chardonnay (Limarí Valley),"On the nose, this Chardonnay smells mostly of oak, with apple and melon notes in the background. Salty oaky flavors mask the wine's fruit, which falls into the stone-fruit category. A barrel-dominated finish with nectarine notes is resiny and salty.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
3640,3641,87,Contini 2015 Elibaria  (Vermentino di Gallura),"Aromas of tropical fruit, yellow apple and fragrant wild flower lead into a straightforward palate offering dried apricot, citrus, bitter almond and a confectionery note. Fresh acidity brightens the finish.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
3641,3642,87,Donato D'Angelo 2013 Calice  (Aglianico del Vulture),"Aromas of woodland berry, damp earth and a whiff of cellar floor lead the nose.

3642,3643,87,Fiuza 2016 3 Castas White (Tejo),"The three grape varieties (castas) are Arinto, Chardonnay and the rare Vital. The result is a light, bright wine dominated by rich acidity, an easy, open texture and just the right amount of crispness at the end. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3643,3644,87,Fluteau NV Cuvée Réservée Brut  (Champagne),This family-owned producer based in the Aube has made a ripe Pinot Noir-dominated wine. It's full and structured with light tannins and minerality. Its acidity and ripe currant fruit lend balanced richness. Drink now.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
3644,3645,87,La Mormoraia 2014 Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),"Aromas of white spring flower, oak-driven vanilla and a whiff of white stone fruit lead the nose.

3646,3647,87,Mercer 2014 Reserve Cavalie Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Merlot (63%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (25%) and Malbec. Brooding aromas of herb, pencil lead, vanilla and spice are followed by dry dark-fruit flavors. The midpalate seems lacking, and the tannins show a touch of astringency.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
3647,3648,87,Morini 2015 Sette Note Secco Albana (Romagna),"This offers subdued aromas suggesting pear, acacia, sage and hazelnut that carry onto the ripe palate along with yellow peach. Bitter almond marks the finish.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
3648,3649,87,Nicolas Potel 2013 La Pucelle Premier Cru  (Rully),"The fruitiness in this tight wine is still developing, hiding for now behind a bitter, toasty character. That should soften as the wine fills out—from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3649,3650,87,Palagetto 2013 Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),"Aromas of toast, French oak, pressed yellow flower and white stone fruit lead the way. The rather lean palate offers yellow apple skin, bitter almond, saline and a honey note.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
3650,3651,87,Quinta do Casal Monteiro 2014 Forma de Arte Reserva Red (Tejo),This half-and-half blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon is structured and with a firm layer of tannins.

3651,3652,87,Sandler 2015 Peterson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"An extremely light and lithe take on the region, this shows light red fruit and a gravel and riverstone quality on the nose. There is chalky structure to the sip, with tart and bright red plum skin flavors, but it's rather dull overall, albeit cleanly made.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
3652,3653,87,Santa Rita 2016 120 Reserva Especial Chardonnay (Central Valley),"No, this is not a misprint. This $6 Chardonnay is a quaffer's dream. Aromas of apple and pear are clean and pleasant.

3656,3657,89,Rooster Hill NV Bubbly Bantam Sparkling (Finger Lakes),"Bantam Bubbly is a delightfully fun, fizzy blend of often-ignored hybrid grapes (Vidal Blanc, Seyval Blanc and Cayuga White). Just a touch sweet, as if glazed with honey and sugar cookie crumbles, it offers loads of sweet-tart lemon and lime flavors. Delicate effervescence and refreshing acidity make it irresistibly gulpable.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,

3658,3659,89,Lexington 2013 Gist Ranch Estate Malbec (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Blueberry, blackberry, black pepper and smoke swirl into a rather reserved and elegant nose on this bottling, one of the few Malbecs made in the mountainous region.

3659,3660,89,Macari 2015 Katherine's Field Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"Bigger, bolder swathes of fresh grapefruit, gooseberry and citrus distinguish the Katherine's Field from it's sister bottling, the Life Force.

3739,3740,92,L'Amandine 2011 Bel Air Red,"It's fading a bit at the rim, but it's a treat to know that mature releases like this are in the market. Age has mellowed its tannins to silky smoothness, while the aromas and flavors resemble thyme blossoms, cherries and leather. Hints of herbal tea and mocha linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now–2022.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
3740,3741,93,Pommery 1998 Grand Cru Brut  (Champagne),"A fine vintage, which shows some age from a relatively fast-maturing year, but is now nicely poised between the initial fresh green fruits and grapefruit flavors, and the elements of toast and yeast that are developing well. This is a great food wine, with some weight and ripeness.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3741,3742,93,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2006 Gemini White Wine White (Napa Valley),"From Chiles Valley, this blend of 71% Semillon and 29% Sauvignon Blanc is one of the best wines of its type of the vintage. Cofermented and barrel aged in 15% new French oak, it shows extraordinary richness, and savory flavors of green and yellow tree fruits, green tea, cashew, Asian spices and gingery vanilla. It even has some dusty tannins that make for grip and structure. The finish is absolutely dry.",Anonymous,
3742,3743,93,Szepsy 2002 Aszú 6 Puttonyos Tokaji (Tokaj),"Though this dessert wine is already excellent, it's quite exciting to imagine how good it will be as its delicate flavors mingle over time. Made by the Szepsy family, whose roots go centuries (perhaps 1,000 years) deep in Hungary, the wine starts with a dense, slightly musky but floral nose. On the tongue, apricot, honey and spice mingle in a rich, opulent union, buoyed by a sparkling acidity that keeps the wine light and pretty.",Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa
3743,3744,93,Lamborghini 2003 Campoleone Red (Umbria),"The best word to describe this impressive Sangiovese-Merlot blend from Umbria is “healthy.” It has a vibrant, ruby red color and delivers absolutely immaculate aromas of succulent cherry, violet, balsamic notes, earth and root beer. It imparts soft, silky tannins, bright acidity and ends only after having carefully caressed each taste bud.",Anonymous,
3744,3745,93,Masciarelli 2004 Marina Cvetic  (Trebbiano d'Abruzzo),"This wine brings the Trebbiano grape to a whole new level of sophistication. You'll get stone fruit, melon and apricot, but you'll also be rewarded with radically unique aromas of melted butter, brown sugar and crunchy crème caramel. The texture is smooth and firm and the wine's persistency can be counted in minutes.",Anonymous,
3745,3746,93,Cesari 2001 Il Bosco  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"Cesari hits all the right marks with this single-vineyard wine and presents a gorgeous, proudly modern wine with soft plush notes of chocolate, vanilla coffee, smoked ham and natural rubber. It is chewy and firm in the mouth but ends on a fresh note, leaving the palate glossed and clean.",Anonymous,
3746,3747,93,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils 2002 Fleuron Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"This recently released 2002 is still showing its youth, with a firm, mineral edge to it. But it does have the right refreshingly crisp character, along with intense fruits, and acidity that just powers right through. Wait 3–4 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3747,3748,93,Cecilia Beretta 2001 Terre di Cariano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"An exciting achievement, this select cru throbs with powerful intensity and complexity awarding a long list of adjectives to describe its aromatic qualities: black cherry and cherry liquor, leather, cola, milk chocolate and almond. Berry and bramble flavors make the mouthfeel lively and sophisticated and are a delicate segue into chewy-tart tannins and a spice driven finale.",Anonymous,
3748,3749,93,Vaona 2000 Pegrandi  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Gorgeous color and concentration with brilliant ruby highlights make this a beautiful wine to contemplate in the glass. The aromas are broad and far-reaching with a high mineral component, small berry fruit, spice and a distinct soapy-lavender element. Chewy, firm and succulent, it's a mouth-watering bruiser that leaves a lasting imprint on the palate. Only 60 cases made.",Anonymous,
3749,3750,92,Volpe Pasini 2005 Zuc di Volpe Pinot Bianco (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Solid, luscious and silky smooth, this white wine from the northern Friuli region is one of the most beautiful expressions of the Pinot Bianco grape you'll find. Stone fruit and nutty tones are rich and penetrating and backed by more fruit and white flowers. Half the wine sees four months of oak to shape its creamy consistency and heightened complexity.",Anonymous,
3750,3751,92,Novelty Hill 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is just about perfect Sémillon— the gorgeous fruit has more flesh and breadth with flavors suggesting ripe fig, melon and citrus. The use of oak is judicious and thoughtful; it adds grace notes without dominating. You can't help but wonder why this grape remains such a novelty (except, ironically, at Novelty Hill!). It's seductive, delicious and unique.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3751,3752,92,Stevens 2004 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"Dark and dense, yet somehow soft and approachable, this 100% is once again loaded with rich black fruits.

The wine is well-rounded in the mouth with fresh acidity at the back and dusty mineral flavors on the finish.",Anonymous,
3753,3754,83,Baron Herzog 1998 Old Vine Zinfandel (California),"Smells a little hot and rubbery, with stewed-prune, tomato, spice and earth notes. Smooth and ripe, with plenty of nice fruit. A rough, rustic character comes through on the finish.",Anonymous,
3754,3755,83,Jepson NV Burnee Hill Vineyard Blanc de  (Mendocino County),"This simple, fruity wine is a long way from real Champagne, despite the presence of that word on the label. There’s a touch of sweetness, and the flavors of baked apples lead into a somewhat clumsy finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3755,3756,83,Ste. Chapelle NV Sparkling Brut  (Idaho),"Delicate floral aromas mark this slighty sweet bubbly. The flavors are typically Riesling, including green apple, honeysuckle and apricot, all backed by good acidity. The finish is clean and a little sugary.",Anonymous,
3756,3757,82,Girardet 1998 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Rather sharp and dominated by piquant cranberry and field aromas. Light in color, with lean red-fruit flavors. A little green and heavily oaked—the dill and pickle from the wood show boldly. Has some good characteristics, but they’re just too hard to get at. From the hotter reaches of southern Oregon.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
3757,3758,82,Fetzer 1997 Home Ranch Zinfandel (California),"Ripe, briary aromas of wild berries, plums and earth veer into dark chocolate. Flavors are on the light side, and seem a little soft.

3758,3759,81,Hauer of the Dauen 1998 Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Some green manure notes and more general barnyard aromas provide aromatic interest but can’t make up for excessively tart cherry fruit and an oddly cloying finish,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
3759,3760,81,Barefoot Cellars NV Barefoot Bubbly  (California),"This is a semi-sweet wine marked by spearmint and rhubarb aromas and clean fruity flavors. The acidity is okay, and it’s well made. Doesn’t have much in common with Champagne but some will like it. From Barefoot Cellars.",Anonymous,
3760,3761,80,Korbel NV Rouge  (Sonoma County),"This isn’t a rosé; it’s much too dark for that, as deeply colored as Pinot Noir. Oddly, there’s not much fruit in either the aroma or the flavor; it’s more of an earthy, watery quality. If you try, you can imagine strawberries, but it’s a stretch. This odd wine is very dry and has some decent acidity.",Anonymous,
3761,3762,80,Amity 1999 Eco Wine Cattrall Brothers Pinot Noir (Oregon),"If you are allergic to sulfites or insist on certified organic wines, this one fits the bill. Unfortunately it's heavy on the grape-juice characteristic, with sharp acids running the show. Dense and chewy, and there's an odd grapefruit note at the end.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
3762,3763,87,R.H. Phillips 1999 Estate Bottled Viognier (Dunnigan Hills),"Ripe and solid, this is a thoroughly enjoyable California example of this Rhône varietal. The wine presents an enticing bouquet of tropical fruits, floral scents, vanilla, even a hint of banana. The palate is medium weight, with citrus and more vanilla flavors. Closes nicely with light spice and toasty accents.",Anonymous,
3763,3764,93,Glen Fiona 1997 Basket Press Reserve Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"75% Syrah and 25% Cinsault from the oldest continually cultivated vinifera vineyard in the Walla Walla Valley. The spicy, intensely aromatic nose mixes black cherry, concentrated cassis, coffee, bacon, leather and roasted nuts. It unfolds in layer upon layer of rich fruit, tannin, leather and smoke. Dense, deep and Rhône-like, it finishes with a montage of meaty, peppery, bacon-smoke flavors.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3764,3765,92,Hyatt 1998 Ice Wine Black Muscat (Yakima Valley),"What a pleasant surprise awaits you here: It's delectable, decadent and downright delicious.

This charmer, which features perfect vitality and acidity, is almost too easy to drink and enjoy.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
3765,3766,92,Domaine Laroche 1997 Les Blanchots  (Chablis),"Very light mango, pineapple and banana aromas are joined by flowers and minerals. Nutty notes are brought to the fore on the dry and stony palate. Finishes broad and long, with echos of the floral and mineral notes on the nose. Now it's pretty tight; best in 2002 and beyond.",Anonymous,
3766,3767,92,Hedges 1997 Red Mountain Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one-third Merlot blend, this is the winery’s prestige cuvée. Lushly perfumed with blueberry, black cherry and red fruits, it’s high-toned and assertive. A serious effort that is still tight as a drum, tannic and deeply streaked with black spices, smoke, tar and coffee.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3767,3768,91,Andrew Will 1999 Pepper Bridge Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Darker and more closed-up than the Ciel du Cheval bottling, this is a medium-bodied red wine with dusty cherry and cassis scents, and hints of tar, coffee, herb and leather. It's muscular and edgy, with tons of potential.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3768,3769,90,Lorenzi Estate 2009 Series Zinfandel (Temecula),"This patiently aged wine delivers a dynamic and rich nose with aromas of plums, cassis, cola, Dr Pepper, chocolate syrup and well-spiced German chocolate cake. Those ripe elements are tamed on the tart and lively palate that shows sour plum skins alongside star anise, beef blood and dank herbs.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
3769,3770,90,Lundeen 2013 Juliard Vineyard Old Vine Riesling (Dundee Hills),"This has compelling intensity, with the extra dimensions that vines more than four decades old can offer. The concentrated apple and pear fruit is pure, deep and lingering. The wine is finished off dry.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3770,3771,90,Paix Sur Terre 2014 Kiler Grove Vineyard Ugni Blanc (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),"This rarely explored grape, also known as Trebbiano, proves quite exciting in this bottling. Aromas recall ripe lime flesh, white flowers, green apples, Asian pears and white peach, with a nearly tropical banana sap character. The palate tightens around the limey acidity, showing some ripe red apple, but remaining bright, ready to pair with everything from roast chicken to shellfish.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
3771,3772,90,Amici 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Floral and lush, this majority Cabernet Sauvignon contains 10% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot, combining for a structured, layered wine accented in black cherry, cedar and dried herb. From vineyards strewn across the Napa Valley, including mountainside sites, it offers power and finesse and should sit well in cellar through 2022.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
3772,3773,90,Armanino Family Cellars 2012 The Ringneck Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Juicy and big-bodied, this is a balanced expression of earthy black cherry and well-honed structure.

3773,3774,90,Blakeslee 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Chehalem Mountains),"Rich and fruity, this reserve adds layers of spice and citrus to the peachy core of the regular bottling.

3774,3775,90,Domaine Cauhapé 2013 Ballet d'Octobre  (Jurançon),"Harvested at the end of October, this gently sweet wine has hints of botrytis along with ripe apricot and honey flavors. It is shot through with delicious acidity that gives the wine a great lift and final freshness.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3775,3776,90,Domaine Nigri 2013 Pierre de Lune  (Jurançon Sec),"This rich and ripe wine is full of apricot and almond flavors.

3776,3777,90,Domaine Rotier 2013 Les Gravels Red (Gaillac),"This wine has an intense structure while not losing sight of fruit. It's a solid wine with dominant tannins.

3777,3778,90,Skouras 2013 Zoe White (Peloponnese),"This blend of Roditis and Moscofilero offers floral, flirty aromas and a palate that's both fresh and layered. Flavors of lemon, violet and orange are rounded but balanced by lively acidity.",Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa
3778,3779,90,St. Urbans-Hof 2012 Nik Weis Schodener Saarfeilser Marienberg Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel),"Decadent white floral tones persist throughout this dry, gorgeously perfumed Riesling.

3779,3780,90,I Giusti e Zanza 2014 Memorino White (Toscana),"Here's a fresh, savory white made from Trebbiano and Sémillon grapes. It opens with aromas of pineapple, exotic fruit and white wildflowers that carry over to the linear palate alongside Mediterranean herb, yellow peach and lemon zest. Tangy acidity provides balance and generates a crisp, clean finish.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
3780,3781,90,Lomas del Valle 2014 Coastal Cool Climate Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Cherry and berry aromas are direct and vivid, with a slight touch of spice. There's energy to the palate, which is slightly jammy and creamy. Ripe plum and cherry flavors show mild oak notes, while the finish is bright, bold and deals some chocolaty oak.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
3781,3782,90,Markus Molitor 2012 Haus Klosterberg Feinherb Riesling (Mosel),"Whiffs of sweet pastry and sun-kissed nectarines lend richness to this zesty, off-dry Riesling.

3782,3783,90,Ornellaia 2012 Le Volte Red (Toscana),"Aromas of fleshy black-skinned fruit, kitchen spice and underbrush emerge from this blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon.

3784,3785,90,Ponzi 2014 Pinot Noir Rosé (Willamette Valley),"As sure-fire as the sunrise, Ponzi's Pinot Noir Rosé is always a class act. The floral, strawberry and peppercorn aromas set your mouth watering before the first sip. There's sufficient acidity to take a bit of a chill-down in stride, and the finish, though bone dry, has ample fruit sweetness to round out the mouthfeel.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3785,3786,90,Porca de Murça 2012 Reserva Tinto Red (Douro),"This is a rounded and ripe wine, with generous black fruits and a full, fruity texture.

3786,3787,90,Primus 2013 The Blend Red (Colchagua Valley),"Lightly roasted, leathery berry aromas are oaky but not overly woody or resiny.

3787,3788,90,S.A. Prüm 2012 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel),"Nuances of bramble and grain lend earthy complexity to this otherwise deeply fruity Riesling. Lemon-lime acidity pierces the midpalate, cutting through layers of ripe yellow-cherry and even berry flavors. The finish is lip smackingly sweet. Drink now.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
3788,3789,88,Pondera 2011 Entwined Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Merlot (57%) takes the lead on this lighter-colored wine that offers raspberries, cherries, herbs and woodspice. The fruit flavors are fresh and elegant, with lightly chalky tannins.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport

It's elegant and filled with juicy cherry flavors.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
3790,3791,88,Producta Vignobles 2011 Pavillon la Tourelle  (Haut-Médoc),"With its dusty tannins, this is a structured wine first, a more fruity wine second. It has density, juicy acidity and hints of blueberry and black currant fruits. It's typical of 2011 at this stage, still very firm and tannic. Give it until 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

3794,3795,88,Acacia 2012 Thornton Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Full bodied and bodacious, this is coyly suggestive at first in lemon and ripe pear. From the first come-hither notes, it's full steam ahead in vanilla and a huge expression of sweet oak.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
3795,3796,88,Bernard Magrez 2012 Château Tour Blanche  (Médoc),"Fresh-fruited and well balanced, this has firm tannins that are already well integrated into the black currant flavors and acidity. Solid and structured, it will develop well. The aftertaste brings out the acidity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
3796,3797,88,Burnt Bridge 2012 Coyote Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"This appealing wine offers aromas of blueberry and huckleberry, and drinks like a vinous piece of blueberry pie. It's a bit one-note but it hits that note hard and well.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport

3801,3802,85,Thurston Wolfe 2006 Dr. Wolfe's Family Red Red (Washington),"It's sappy and just a bit rustic, with layers of leather and saddle sweat along with sweet blueberry and blackberry fruit.

3803,3804,85,Cantina del Taburno 2007 Amineo Coda di Volpe (Beneventano),"This Coda di Volpe has a subdued nose that lets aromas of chopped herb and mineral reveal themselves slowly.

3804,3805,85,Viña El Cerno 2006 Utopía Roble Malbec (Mendoza),"Dry and short on fruit, with strong barrel aromas of pepper, cinnamon and resin. In the mouth, there's more wood than fruit, leaving heat, vanilla and spice to overshadow mild strawberry/raspberry flavors. What's best about the wine is the mouthfeel; it's round and creamy, with length. Anyone averse to forward oak should steer clear of Utopía.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

3807,3808,85,Finca El Retiro 2006 Barrica Malbec (Mendoza),"Melted fudge and asphalt are draped on this young wine's bouquet. Given that opening, a palate of black plum and cassis isn't surprising. Feelwise, it's a touch rough and tannic, which is probably to be expected. Turns more herbal the more you sniff and swirl.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
3808,3809,85,C&T; 2006 Patio Pinot Noir (Napa-Sonoma),"A little harsh in the mouth, with minty, peppery flavors and tart acids, but you'll find enough cherry and cola flavor to satisfy, and the structure is silky and light.",Anonymous,

Michelle 2006 Indian Wells Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Consistent with previous bottlings, this is dark, oaky, lush with scents and flavors of butter, toast and roasted nuts. The fruit seems secondary to the parade of butterscotch, brown sugar and spice that comes walloping through the palate. The wine turns slightly bitter in the finish. This is a wine for those who love the California style of Chardonnay.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3810,3811,87,Columbia Crest 2006 Grand Estates Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest is consistently the most broadly fruity, round and oaky wine in the lineup (outside of the much pricier reserve). Apple, pear and peach fruit dominates, and the sometimes too-present, tarted up flavors of butter and vanilla have been brought back into better proportion in this 2006 bottling. Sure to be a popular style, this is one of the best vintages in the past five years.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
3811,3812,87,Fernwood 2005 Small Vineyard Selection Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"More like Zin than Merlot, a peppery, full-bodied wine with some ripe to overripe blackberry, cassis and raisin flavors.

3812,3813,87,Foxen 2005 Vogelzang Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"A bit hot and indelicate, but very ripe, with currant jam and blackberry pie-filling flavors richly layered with smoky, caramelized oak.

3816,3817,87,Three Rivers 2006 Weinbau Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"There's 5% Malbec in the blend, but the austere, scrapey tannins of the Franc still dominate the finish. The fruit is pretty, with blueberry character to burn. The wine hits the palate well in the beginning, but seems to sag a bit midpalate before heading into that astringent finish, enlivened by toasty new oak. If you like blueberries, you'll like this wine.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

3963,3964,92,Kuentz-Bas NV Trois Châteaux Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Luscious stone-fruit notes on the nose suggest ripeness and opulence. The palate speaks with that same generous fruit but holds a tight fresh grip that unites mirabelle, crisp green apple, bright citrus and yeasty richness.

The tannins are extraordinarily thick, but ripe and smoothly sweet. And then there's the fruit, a detonation of blackberries, cherries, blueberries and cassis, not to mention the oak, which seems as fine as oak gets. This superb wine seems like an obvious cellar candidate. It should ride out the decade effortlessly.",Anonymous,
4062,4063,92,Bellavista NV Gran Cuvée Satén Brut Chardonnay (Franciacorta),"A pure expression of Chardonnay, this luminous sparkling wine offers a generous nose with warming tones of yellow rose, apricot, almond paste, baked bread and vanilla cream. The wine spreads smoothly over the palate with a remarkably soft and velvety feel.",Anonymous,
4063,4064,92,Joseph Drouhin 2008 Domaine Drouhin-Vaudon Sécher Premier Cru  (Chablis),"On the south bank of the River Serein, Sécher is one of the lesser known Premier Crus. This is a cool, crisp wine, emphasizing both green fruits and an underlying buttery touch. Beautifully integrated acidity frames the wine.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4064,4065,92,Kendall-Jackson 2008 Vintner's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma-Napa),"A wonderfully good wine, especially at this price. Easily the best K-J Vintner's Reserve ever. Inky black, full-bodied and dry, it houses rich, complex blackberry, plum and smoky oak flavors, wrapped into finely ground, firm tannins. Run, don't walk, to find this affordable beauty.",Anonymous,
4065,4066,92,Arrowood 2007 Monte Rosso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Dryness and tannins mark this Cabernet, giving it some austerity and astringency. But lurking deep below the surface is a vast underground landscape of blackberry fruit, cassis, plums, olives, herbs and oak. Fascinating and intricate and a little heady, but undrinkable now due to immaturity. Needs 5–6 years to show its stuff.",Anonymous,
4066,4067,92,Bella 2008 Maple Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Unmistakably Zinfandel, and Dry Creek at that, with its robust texture, firm tannins and briary, brambly flavors of wild summer berries, chocolate-covered raisins, red licorice and cola, liberally spiced with black pepper. It's a big, voluptuous wine that never loses its sense of balance and harmony. Drink now.",Anonymous,
4067,4068,92,Tulpen 2007 Coalesce Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux blend is three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, yet deftly weaves in smaller percentages of Merlot, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Fruit-driven and complex, it's a smooth ride through fresh fruit flavors of plum, blueberry and cherry, focusing into a finish with ripe, polished tannins.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
4068,4069,92,Arrowood 2007 Reserve Speciale Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Dark as a moonless midnight, dry as dust, with hard-edged tannins, this Cabernet is almost undrinkable now in its extreme youth. It shows a massive core of blackberries, currants, dark baker's chocolate and smoky oak, and the balance of acidity makes it clean and bright. All indications are of a cellarworthy wine. Drink 2014 and beyond.",Anonymous,
4069,4070,84,San Pedro 2012 Epica Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Gritty match-stick aromas come with grapefruit and citrus scents. This is lifted and entirely regular for Chilean Sauvignon Blanc. Flavors of lemon, lime and grapefruit are soft and mealy for such a young wine, while bitterness enters the frame on the finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4070,4071,84,Stroppiana 2009 Gabutti Bussia  (Barolo),"This Barolo shows funky aromas of rubber and animal—common for the scorching 2009 vintage in this area. Despite its core of dark cherry fruit, this is very astringent and brutally tannic, with a short finish. Don't think this will evolve well.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe

4072,4073,83,Anakena 2011 Ona Special Reserve Riesling-Chardonnay-Viognier White (Leyda Valley),"This unusual blend of Riesling, Chardonnay and Viognier is toasty but also stalky smelling, with modest fruit aromas. The palate is plump and simple feeling, with chunky weight and salty flavors of roast corn and bland citrus. Oak and saline define the finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4073,4074,83,Apaltagua 2012 Estate Grown Rosé Carmenère (Central Valley),"Briny citrus and sulfuric match-stick aromas lead to an edgy but fresh palate.

4078,4079,83,Château Los Boldos 2012 Cuvée Tradition Chardonnay (Rapel Valley),"Light in color, light in aromas, light in flavor... that pretty much describes this decent but rudimentary Chardonnay.

4079,4080,83,Dogwood 2010 Sargentini Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino),This old-vine Zinfandel also has Carignane and Petite Sirah and is full of red fruit and decent spice but it falls flat under the weight of alcohol on the finish.,Virginie Boone,@vboone
4080,4081,83,La Clarine Farm 2012 Nr. 2 White (Sierra Foothills),"Hmm. A blend of 50% Sémillon from Amador County and 50% Viognier from El Dorado County that gives off much beyond a slight taste of Asian pear. Cloudy, it is also sharp and herbal.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
4081,4082,83,Carma 2010 Estate Grown Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Soft aromas of raisin and prune lack vitality and indicate what's to come.

4082,4083,83,Concha y Toro 2011 Casillero del Diablo Reserva Chardonnay (Limarí Valley),"This is a round, creamy, soft Chardonnay with resiny aromas. A strange, forced oak flavor dominates the flavor profile, which includes spice more than fruit. On the finish, oak and resin are about all you get.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4083,4084,83,Domaine du Claouset 2011 Réserve  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"A hard and tannic wine, with too much dryness for pleasure. It's not likely to soften enough to balance out.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4084,4085,83,Zinfandelic 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"A dusty Amador County-dominant old-vine Zinfandel with plenty of spicy berry, mocha and licorice flavor. Packaged in a psychedelically inspired label, it'll go down easy on those late-night when listening to music is the best thing to do and plenty of barbecued meat is lying around.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
4085,4086,83,Quivira 2012 Fig Tree Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"Unripe green notes of leaves detract from this wine's enjoyment. It's crisp in acidity, with some pure Meyer lemon, lime and fig flavors, but that vegetal note is bothersome.",Anonymous,
4086,4087,93,Banfi 2011 Poggio alle Mura Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas suggesting ripe plum, exotic spice, blue flower and a whiff of pipe tobacco take shape in the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out ripe black cherry, raspberry, vanilla and a hint of star anise while velvety tannins give it a polished feel. An espresso note signals the close.

4088,4089,93,Domdechant Werner 2015 Hochheim Domdechaney Erste Lage Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),"There's so much body and ripeness in this bold, dry-style Riesling, it's admittedly blousy, but irresistibly so. Voluptuous and alcoholic on the palate, it shows intensely concentrated peach and cantaloupe flavors, as well as a sensual, almost oily, mineral richness. It may not age for decades but offers plenty of hedonistic enjoyment through 2021.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
4089,4090,93,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef) 2015 Bernkasteler Lay Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Pristine orange blossom and tangerine hints turn riper and richer on the palate in this delicately honeyed Riesling. It's lively and deft in mouthfeel, with sweet yellow cherry and peach flavors that dart on the midpalate. A sun-filled yet gorgeously balanced wine, it's calibrated by scintillating acidity and a mineral sheen on the finish.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
4090,4091,93,Fritz Haag 2015 Brauneberger Juffer Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel),"A whiff of smoked nuts lends savory complexity to bright tangerine, pineapple and white floral aromas in this gorgeously steel-toned wine. Dry and minera, yet silken in texture, it hits the palate with staccato notes of crunchy stone fruit, lemon and lime. It's bracing and brisk now but should meld beautifully over the next decade.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
4091,4092,93,Giornata 2013 Luna Matta Vineyard Nebbiolo (Paso Robles),"Vibrant red plum and cherry aromas meet hibiscus, cinnamon and a touch of inviting cotton candy on the nose of this bottling.

4092,4093,93,Grimm's Bluff 2014 Estate Petit Verdot (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Lush caramel, crème de cassis and crushed black rock aromas are backed by a structure that's apparent even from the nose in this bottling from winemaker Paul Lato.

4093,4094,92,Chalk Hill 2014 Wright Creek Chardonnay (Chalk Hill),"From an estate vineyard planted partially to the Robert Young clone, this full-bodied wine opens with doughy biscuit and oak aromas, building towards richer notes of apple and honey.

4097,4098,92,Château Lamartine 2014 Expression Malbec-Tannat (Cahors),"The combination of two naturally tannic grapes has inevitably produced a tannic wine. But the ripe layer of rich black fruits acts as a foil to the density of the wine and gives it both balance and a good future. This is a serious wine that needs to age, so drink from 2020.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4098,4099,92,Cuda Ridge Wines 2013 Reserve Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"Fascinating earthy, spicy aromas and flavors give an extra dimension to this full-bodied and richly textured wine. New leather, cardamom, and cumin scents infuse the aroma, while ripe but not sweet black currant, dark cherry and clove flavors flood the palate. It's rich enough to enjoy now but will be best after 2019.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
4099,4100,92,Domaine Bousquet 2015 Grande Reserve Malbec (Tupungato),"Tarry aromas of blackberry and freshly applied asphalt set up a full-bodied palate with sandpaper tannins.

4100,4101,92,Domdechant Werner 2015 Hochheimer Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau),"A shower of crushed minerals lends transparency to this fleshy dry Riesling.

4103,4104,92,Kaiken 2013 Mai Malbec (Mendoza),"Black in color, this smells of olive, eucalyptus and tarry berry, much like you'd get from a high-end Chilean red. An extracted massive palate is dense and layered, while this tastes of salty black plum and black currant. A toasty smooth finish with mild tannins is herbal and balsamic. Drink through 2021.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4104,4105,92,ONX 2014 Crux Red (Templeton Gap District),"Dark purple fruit is upstaged by the strong umami character on the nose of this blend of 41% Syrah, 32% Mourvèdre and 27% Grenache, reminiscent of soy, shiitake mushroom and beef jerky.

Drink through 2022.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4107,4108,92,Quinta do Portal 2014 Reserva Red (Douro),"This reserve wine is a ripe and smooth blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Franca.

4109,4110,90,Château Bel-Air Ouÿ 2009 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),"89-91 Barrel sample. Owned by Jean-Luc Thunevin of Valandraud, this is an intense - maybe too intense - spicy wine, packed with new wood. There is a juicy character, but structure dominates.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4110,4111,90,Château d'Issan 2009 Barrel sample  (Margaux),"89-91 Barrel sample. The wine has a rustic edge, over very juicy fruit, very blackcurrant, and with a high acid content. It feels light.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

4112,4113,90,Château Haut-Bergey 2009 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),"89-91 Barrel sample. A definite burnt character on the nose, but the fruit has proper richness, the wood perhaps showing too much high toast. The freshness should be kept and not lost in the wood.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4113,4114,90,Château la Tour de Pin Figeac 2009 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),"89-91 Barrel sample. Sweet fruit, soft tannins, ripe wine. The structure takes a while to show with dusty, almost velvet tannins.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

4115,4116,90,Le Nardian 2009 Barrel sample  (Bordeaux Blanc),"89-91 Barrel sample. Very fresh. With just a light touch of wood spice, and a great burst of citrus, grapefruit, a little lychee from Muscadelle.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4116,4117,90,Château Bonalgue 2009 Barrel sample  (Pomerol),"89-91 Barrel sample. A solid chunky sweet wine, with lots of ripe bright fruits, and vivid blackcurrants. With this structure it will age.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4117,4118,90,Château Bouscaut 2009 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),"89-91 Barrel sample. A full-bodied wine that lacks some definition. It has fatness, weight, but the freshness is not all there.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

4132,4133,89,Zanoni 2007 Zovo  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"On the bold and powerful side, this deals lush flavors of dark chocolate, chewy cherry, leather, tobacco and barbecue smoke. Packed with intensity and soft richness, it also delivers a fine point of fresh acidity on the finish.",Anonymous,
4133,4134,89,Zocker 2011 Paragon Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Edna Valley),"This tastes sweeter than the very fine 2009 and 2010, but that may be because the fruit is so powerfully intense and pure.

4134,4135,89,Gratallops 2007 Partida Bellvisos Red (Priorat),"Compared to the excellent 2006, this wine is heavier, riper and jammier at every check point. The nose is baked and raisiny, while the palate feels saturated to the extreme and gritty as well. The primary flavors run toward baked plum and blackberry, while licorice, leather and raisin notes carry the finish. Give this lots of air after opening, about an hour or so.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4135,4136,89,Oakville East 2009 Exposure Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This is hard to appreciate now because the fruit is so primary and upfront—like a heaping spoon of black raspberry jam—and also because the tannins are thick and tough. There's something almost rustic about it. On the other hand, six years or more in the cellar could reward. Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with a splash of Petit Verdot.",Anonymous,

4138,4139,89,La Chablisienne 2010 Les Vénérables  (Chablis),"While the wine seems at first rich, it then shows a tautly acidic character that gives a refreshing character to the roundness. That steely acidity is what defines the tight, crisp finish.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4139,4140,89,Le Bertarole 2008 Podere Le Marognole  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Modern and oak driven, this has aromas of toasted almond, chocolate, tobacco and crushed clove.

4141,4142,89,Gino Fasoli 2007 Alteo  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"The 17.5% alcohol is a bit much, but the burning effect is dampened by the mouthfeel's extraordinary thickness and richness.

4144,4145,89,Blue Plate 2011 Dry Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg),"This bottling is even better than the 2010: drier, crisper and more elegant, without a trace of sweetness. It's balanced, with a long finish that should pair well with any kind of spiced food.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
4145,4146,89,Cesari 2010 Mara  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso),"This offers a slightly less formal and austere expression compared to Cesari's Bosan. Perfect for chicken or pork roast, this delivers fresh acidity beyond the tones of cherry, cola, leather and barbecue spice.",Anonymous,
4146,4147,89,Chandon NV Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (California),"While this bubbly is technically dry, it tastes sweetly infused with the essence of strawberries and vanilla.

4151,4152,87,Undurraga 2008 Sibaris Reserva Especial Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"A little murky and muddled on the nose, this has an earthy-berry aroma, with a hint of floral-based perfume. It offers acidity and solidity on the palate, which is backed by standard black-fruit flavors, with undertones of vanilla and raw oak. Very good, but it's a bit oaky.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4152,4153,87,Wait Cellars 2009 Devoto Garden Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"This has flavors of cherry and blackberry jam, cola and spice. It's crisp in acidity and dry, as Pinot should be. This is direct and polished; it's not likely to get better with age, so drink now.",Anonymous,

4154,4155,87,Hug 2009 el Pape Red (Central Coast),"This Rhône-style blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah has plenty of cherry and mocha deliciousness. It seems a bit sweet on the finish, so drink it with compatible foods, like bacon.",Anonymous,
4155,4156,87,Clos La Chance 2011 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast),"There's lots of spicy richness in this slightly sweet Sauvignon Blanc. With zesty acidity, its flavors veer toward pineapples, limes, melons and vanilla. This should be versatile with all kinds of foods.",Anonymous,
4156,4157,87,Conway 2009 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"This is very rich, ripe and oaky, but a little over the top, with strong flavors of buttered toast, caramel, orange jam and spice. An outgoing wine crafted in the popular style.",Anonymous,

4159,4160,87,Eagle Eye 2007 Alpha Wolf Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The flavors of this Cabernet are enormously rich. Blackberry and blueberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and cassis come in waves. Few wines on earth are this ripe. The issue is balance and complexity, both of which could be stronger. Drink over the next few years.",Anonymous,

4167,4168,87,Pech Merle 2010 Treborce Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"This has a powerful, briary character, with a spicy, high-alcohol kick.

4168,4169,87,Saintsbury 2009 Brown Ranch Chardonnay (Carneros),"This shows the dried herb character that often characterizes Napa Chardonnay, giving the pineapple and orange flavors an earthiness.

4169,4170,84,Lawer 2015 Rosé of Syrah (Knights Valley),"Entirely varietal, and given five months to gel in stainless steel, this is a dark copper-red wine that's noticeably earthy on the nose. Dry, woody and a touch sour in cherry and strawberry, it should be enjoyed chilled and with ceviche.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
4170,4171,84,Torres 2012 Escaleras de Empedrado Pinot Noir (Maule Valley),"Scattered aromas of horseradish, cotton candy and vinegar are all over the map but don't convey varietal character or purity. This new wine from terraced vineyards in deep, rural Maule feels clipped, with heavy tannins. Mixed berry flavors are bitter and rubbery, and the finish is grabby and awkward. This is a first release; suffice it to say it needs more work to justify its price.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4171,4172,84,Apaltagua 2015 Reserva Rosé (Maule Valley),"Super light in color, with aromas of grape skins, nectarine and briny seashell, this rosé from Carmenère feels highly citric and shearing.

4172,4173,84,Byington 2014 Ventana Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey County),"Extremely grassy on the nose, this also shows lime juice and a skunky cannabis character that starts to blow off with time. The texture is racy on the palate, but the grassy component proves rather sour and one-dimensional.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
4173,4174,84,Ravoire et Fils 2015 Domaine des Bellugues Rosé (Mediterranée),"Named after the lightning bugs (bellugues means spark) that lived in the nearby woods, this wine is all fresh fruit and soft texture.

4174,4175,84,3 Badge Beverage 2014 Gehricke Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This wine reminds one of salty apple pie, with big, drying oak and a whiff of potpourri.

4175,4176,84,Case Bianche 2015 Barone Beneventano del Bosco White (Sicilia),This blend of Inzolia and Chardonnay has subdued aromas of orchard fruit and nut. The simple palate offers lime and citrus zest alongside brisk acidity.,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
4176,4177,84,La Clarine Farm 2014 Jambalaia Rouge Red (Sierra Foothills),"This wine has potent berry, funky earth and herb aromas.

4177,4178,84,Montes 2014 Twins Red (Colchagua Valley),"Heavy aromas of oak, char and syrupy berry fruits don't smell entirely natural. This feels tannic and scratchy, with missing parts.

4178,4179,84,Pelvillain Frères 2014 Zee Original Malbec (Côtes du Lot),"The wine is perfumed and full. It is so soft, missing tannins, and already easy to drink. Black fruits are super-ripe and generous. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

4180,4181,84,Jelly Jar 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lake County),"This extreme wine has vivid earthy aromas like wood smoke and cured meats and equally smoky, meaty flavors. The mouthfeel is quite dry and tannic, and any fruit flavors take a back seat to the gamey character.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
4181,4182,84,La Croix du Pin 2012 Cuvée Prestige Medium Sweet Muscat (Pays d'Oc),"Pleasant aromas of stone fruit, candied orange peel and white gummy bear waft from the glass and carry through to the round, fruity palate.

4183,4184,84,Montalvo Wilmot 2013 MW Quintos de la Tejera Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Floral, spicy plum aromas come with notes of lemon and chili pepper.

4184,4185,84,Producta Vignobles 2015 Cabane aux Oiseaux Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"The caramel character of this wine is less attractive than its background of red fruits. The two sides need to come into balance for it to work completely, so wait until late 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4185,4186,87,Nuna 2011 Reserve Torrontés (Salta),"Oily and almondy on the nose, but also layered and stacked. Feels lively, jumpy and pumped full of acidity, then tastes of classic lychee and green melon. Full and driving, with citrusy zest to the tail end.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4186,4187,87,Parducci 2009 Small Lot Blend Pinot Noir (California),"Good price for a deliciously drinkable Pinot Noir. It's silky and a little sweet in raspberries, brown sugar and bacon flavors. Easy to drink and at this price, it can be your house Pinot.",Anonymous,
4187,4188,87,Peter Zemmer 2007 Cortinie Bianco White (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),"Cortinie Bianco opens with impressive intensity and lasting aromas of peach cobbler, vanilla cream and preserved peaches. It follows with a smooth, dense texture in the mouth.",Anonymous,

4189,4190,87,Nuna 2010 Reserve Bonarda (Mendoza),"Lots of fruit is apparent right from the start, with cassis, raspberry, red plum and cotton candy aromas.

4190,4191,87,Rock Wall 2010 Obsidian Red (Red Hills Lake County),"Rock Wall seems to release its wines pretty young, and this too could use a little time. A blend of half Zinfandel and half Petite Sirah from the obsidian-laden hills of Lake County's Red Hills area, a very promising spot for Cabernet in particular. Still hugely tannic, this mix is yummy in dusty black fruit, leather and dark chocolate.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
4191,4192,87,Coelho 2010 Estate Renovação Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"All stainless steel barrel-fermented, this is already a rich gold color and showing soft, quickly maturing apple fruit flavors.

4192,4193,87,Comelli 2010 Amplius Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Friuli in northeast Italy has the unique soils and climatic conditions for full bodied and sophisticated white wines. This Pinot Grigio offers the easy, approachable qualities we associate with the grape with that added dimension or creaminess that is so characteristic of the region.",Anonymous,
4193,4194,87,Corvalle 2010 Rutherford Runway Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"There's a grassiness to this Sauvignon Blanc that suggests the cool vintage that yielded it. At the same time, the lemon and lime flavors make it rich. With no oak, the fruit stars, brightened with crisp, clean acidity. The finish is a little too sweet, which detracts from the score.",Anonymous,
4194,4195,87,De Stefani 2010 Tai Tocai (Veneto),"Tai (made with 100% Tocai grapes) is a lively white wine with fragrant aromas of yellow rose, honeysuckle and passion fruit. A thick, creamy mouthfeel is loaded tight with rich honey flavors.",Anonymous,

4199,4200,87,Albino Armani 2009 Colle Ara Pinot Grigio (Valdadige),"Colle Ara opens with a light copper color that reflects the natural hue of the grape skins of Pinot Grigio. The aromas include white almond, grapefruit and peach cobbler and the mouthfeel is fresh but creamy at the same time.",Anonymous,
4200,4201,87,Broglia 2009 La Meirana  (Gavi),"One of the best qualities of Gavi is that tight, mineral note of talc powder or crushed stone that holds it all together.

4201,4202,93,Testarossa 2006 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),"Testarossa's track record with this wine has been on an upward spiral.

4202,4203,93,Kynsi 2005 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This pretty Pinot Noir is drinking well now, but has the depth to last for a while.

4203,4204,93,Von Strasser 2005 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District),"The very tannic '05 reserve is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc. It's fleshy and rich in blackberry, cassis and tobacco flavors, with lots of new toasty oak, and there's something meaty, like ground hamburger with a splash of tamari. Utterly delicious and very fine, this low-production bottling should evolve over many years.",Anonymous,
4204,4205,93,Testarossa 2006 Fritschen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A beautiful Pinot Noir, lilting, refined and utterly delicious.

4205,4206,93,Concha y Toro 2005 Don Melchor Cabernet Sauvignon (Puente Alto),"This comes across as the best Don Melchor that Concha y Toro has produced, and at $69 it should be.

4212,4213,92,Von Strasser 2005 Post Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Von Strasser has a good track record with this wine, and the '05 is right up there with the best, but be forewarned. It's very tannic. But then, it is from Diamond Mountain. Give it a good 4 years, at least, to throw some sediment and let the rich blackberry and black currant flavors emerge. Should hold well for 15 years.",Anonymous,
4213,4214,92,Von Strasser 2005 Rainin Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Very hard in tannins, with a real lockdown astringency in the mouth, this is one for the cellar, and it's a slam dunk that age will reward it.

4243,4244,86,Gamache 2008 Estate Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hard and tannic at first, this young wine grudgingly reveals a core of very tart cherry fruit, encased in flavors of stem and wood. A coffee-infused finish does not conceal the chewy, tough tannins.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

4408,4409,86,La Querciolina 2013 Sassetti Livio  (Montecucco),"The shy nose eventually reveals suggestions of red berry, aromatic herb and a whiff of game. The bright simple palate offers red cherry, clove and an earthy note alongside mellow tannins.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
4409,4410,86,Valle Secreto 2014 Key Malbec (Cachapoal Valley),"Gritty horsey berry aromas lead to a medium-bodied, basic palate. This tastes of blackberry and savory spices, while the finish is mild in flavor and short on length.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

4411,4412,86,Leyda 2015 Single Vineyard Kadún Sauvignon Gris (Leyda Valley),"Initial aromas of canned peas and green fruits are classic Leyda.

4412,4413,86,Liberty Lake 2011 Aquila Red (Red Mountain),"Aromas of dried fruit and barrel spice lead to tart, slightly dilute seeming fruit flavors backed by lightly gritty tannins. It seems a bit evolved for its age.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
4413,4414,86,Iron Hub 2013 Esola Zinfandel (Amador County),"Rather light, easy-to-enjoy aromas suggesting fresh strawberry and raspberry, along with equally fruity flavors don't indicate how full-bodied and high-octane this wine is.

4415,4416,86,Casas del Bosque 2015 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Pungent pyrazine-heavy aromas of bell pepper and asparagus are typical for this winery.

4417,4418,86,Santa Rita 2015 Reserva Syrah (Maipo Valley),Spicy grassy aromas of catmint are matched by unusual clove scents.

4418,4419,86,H to H 2014 Homage to Heritage Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This crisp, lively red shows off the herbal notes of Provence—what the French call garrigue—and tart cherry fruit. It's less ripe than many Côtes du Rhône wines, but bright and mouthwatering. Drink now–2020.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4419,4420,86,Junta 2014 Momentos Reserve Malbec (Curicó Valley),"Campfire, animal, horseradish and berry aromas make for a slightly difficult nose. This Malbec feels pinched, with tannic pull.

4420,4421,86,Junta 2015 Momentos Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"Clean pear and apple aromas come in front of a citrusy palate with just enough shearing acidity to keep things balanced.

Now–2012.",Anonymous,
4431,4432,93,Olson Ogden 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"This is a deeply ripe, authoritatively structured Syrah of great power and finesse. It's drinkable now for the velvety texture and massive flavors of grilled blackberries, blueberries, currants, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather, black pepper and lots of sweet, smoky new oak.

4432,4433,93,Olson Ogden 2007 Unti Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"This is the biggest, most tannic and closed of the winery's three new 2007 Syrahs, and also the one most likely to improve in the cellar. It's intense and concentrated in pure blackberry and black cherry fruit, with the pepper, bacon, earth and smoky oak notes you want in a good 100% Syrah. But then, there are those big tannins. Give it a good 4–6 years.",Anonymous,
4433,4434,93,Stonestreet 2005 Christopher's Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Not ready for drinking now. Shows youthfully aggressive tannins and forward flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and unintegrated new oak, making it the least satisfactory of Stonestreet's impressive new releases if you're looking for something now. Seems like it will make a very fine bottle after 2011 or so.",Anonymous,
4434,4435,93,La Fenêtre 2007 Calmant Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Feels a bit thick and heavy now, with jammy raspberry, cherry, mocha and sandalwood flavors, but so good, so pure that a few years in the cellar have to benefit.

4435,4436,93,Weinrieder 2007 Alte Reben Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"The concentration here is enormous, from low-yielding old vines.

Age ideally for 3–4 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4436,4437,93,Gloria Ferrer 2006 Brut Rosé Sparkling (Sonoma County),"The first duty of a blush bubbly is to be delicious and elegant, and this one is, despite the full-bodied flavors from a majority of Pinot Noir.

Really fine, with a good backbone of tannins. Now–2011.",Anonymous,
4438,4439,93,Titus 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Titus's regular '06 Cab is a wonderful wine.

4443,4444,93,Château Suau 2008 Barrel sample  (Barsac),"92-94 Barrel sample. With its big, almost dry core of botrytis, this is going to be an intense wine - many years from now. For the present, the acidity gives it some freshness, while it remains concentrated.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4444,4445,93,Château Faugères 2006 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),"92—94 Barrel sample. A dark, meaty wine, very new world in its richness and opulence. It is concentrated, packed with black fruit.—R.V.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

4447,4448,86,Bodegas Berceo 2013 Viñadrian  (Rioja),"Earthy notes of saline and cheesy leather accent plum aromas on this tight number with rubbery tannins. Plum, cherry and herbal flavors carry some bitterness onto a finish with medicinal plum notes.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4448,4449,86,Galatea Effect 2013 Conoscenti Rosé (California),"Not a simple refreshment, this has a deep pink color tinged with copper. In aroma and flavor it's almost as substantive as a red wine.

4449,4450,86,Lagana 2013 Breezy Slope Vineyard Pinot Noir (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Grown in the southern section of the valley in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, this rare varietal bottling from this appellation shows aromas of cranberry, raspberry and citrus, along with some hints of oxidation.

4451,4452,86,Matsu 2013 El Picaro  (Toro),"Rough, animal-like aromas wrestle with piercing, fairly hot plum and berry scents. Rubbery, blackened, peppery plum and raspberry flavors finish oaky, mildly bitter and tannic.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

4454,4455,85,Ignacio Marín 2012 Ballad Garnacha (Cariñena),"Prune and raisin aromas are dominant and suggest overripeness.

4455,4456,85,La Cignozza 2009 Riserva  (Chianti),"Aromas of tilled earth, leather, ripe black-skinned fruit and a gamey note set the stage for this funky wine. The overripe palate displays fleshy black plum, dried blue flowers and bitter barnyard sensations set against a backdrop of soft acidity. Drying, astringent tannins cut the finish short.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe

4458,4459,85,Goose Ridge 2014 Estate Bottled Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In this straightforward quaffer, aromas of pear, melon and apple lead to off-dry fruit flavors with a full feel.

4460,4461,85,Piandibugnano 2008 Cuccallegro White (Montecucco),"There are distant floral notes here, but in general this blend of Trebbiano and Vermentino from Grosseto, Tuscany seems initially closed. Perfumed aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle do burst through from time to time and the wine is crisp and snappy on the close.",Anonymous,
4461,4462,85,Porta 2008 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Aconcagua Valley),"A bit foxy and jumpy at first, and then familiar aromas of berry and plum settle in.

4462,4463,85,Raphael 2008 Grand Cru Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"A medium bouquet of apple, lemon and a touch of fresh young peach. The oak is there but not overpowering.

The finish is toasty  with a lingering vanilla bean note.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
4466,4467,85,Concha y Toro 2008 Casillero del Diablo Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"For a huge-volume wine, it's what we'd expect. Controlled oak results in aromas of coffee, vanilla, marshmallow and resin in addition to cassis and cherry, while the palate offers generic fruit flavors as well as vanilla and herbal notes. A bit puckery and scratchy, but keep in mind that annual production tops 1.3 million cases.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4467,4468,85,Cave de Ribeauvillé 2007 Prestige Riesling (Alsace),"A very flowery interpretation with gardenia, freesia and carnations on the nose that carry over to the palate where they merge with fresh orange peel. There's only moderate intensity and complexity here, but the exceptionally pretty nose and the crisp, linear finish make for a nice overall package. Serve with flounder. Should be drunk up in a year or two.",Anonymous,
4468,4469,85,Macari 2007 Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"With 12 months in French oak, the Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay is a rounder, more spice-infused Chard than Macari's regular Estate Bottled offering. As big as it is, the nose is somewhat muted with soft notes of pear and yellow flowers and the palate shows more as a result of the oak (spice, toast) than the fruit.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
4469,4470,85,Muscardini 2007 Gracie Creek Vineyards Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Sharpness compromises this wine. Whether the acidity is natural or added, it's intrusive, cutting the palate and giving a sour candy taste to the blackberries, currants and cherries. Ready now.",Anonymous,
4470,4471,85,Santa Carolina 2008 Reserva de Familia Malbec (Rapel Valley),"Very dark and grapey, with raisin, licorice and bite to the bouquet.

4475,4476,85,Kawarau Estate 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (Central Otago),"Something of a letdown after the top-rank showing of the 2006, the 2007 is marked by a slightly sour, lactic character, which accentuates the wine's sweet-corn fruit. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft, maybe a little too soft—so drink it over the next few months.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4476,4477,86,Château Lajarre 2014 Cuvée Eléonore  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"The wine is firm and structured although with enough fruit weight to give the wine a good potential for aging. Still full of young energy, it is going to develop balance.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4477,4478,86,Château Malbat 2014 Optimus  (Bordeaux),Spice and some firm tannins mark this wine. It has a red-fruit character as well as a more earthy backdrop. With its structure it will need to sit until 2017.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
4478,4479,86,Chehalem 2013 Ridgecrest Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Some might say this is old-school Oregon Pinot, with an emphasis on herbal acidic flavors and thin tart fruits. Despite aggressive aeration, the wine refuses to open up, and the impression of barely ripe fruit and chalky acids lingers.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
4479,4480,86,City Winery Chicago 2013 Lake Shore Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This wine has a generosity of tannin that can be distracting, as the rest of its boldness seeks to make room for flavors of tart cherry, leather and hint of almond extract. Medium bodied, it veers into ripe characteristics that can come off as heat, particularly on the finish.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
4480,4481,86,Conde de Subirats NV Cava Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava),"Gritty, wild aromas of leafy, herbal citrus fruits and compost lead to a foamy palate with solid acidity. Gritty, spicy citrus flavors are slightly bitter, and the wine falls off on the finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4481,4482,86,Consejo de la Alta 2013 Alta Río Crianza  (Rioja),"Earthy, gritty, animal aromas are a bit raw as they blend with currant and red-plum scents.

For starters, it smells more like hickory than fruit. Soon blackberry and prune aromas and flavors get into the game, but even then the back palate and finish are resiny. Some citric acidity in the center keeps it keen but raises questions about balance.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4580,4581,86,Santa Julia 2007 Organica Malbec (Mendoza),"Blueberry with snap is the way to describe the bouquet on this fresh and spunky young Malbec. The flavors are sweet and intense, just like grapes off the vine. It doesn't offer much complexity but at the same time it doesn't taste confected or flawed in any way.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4581,4582,86,Summerer 2007 Grüne Lady Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Fresh, light, and deliciously refreshing, this summertime Grüner Veltliner is full of light, playful acidity and green currant fruits. It's crisp, easy to drink. Glass stopper.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4582,4583,86,Tagaris 2006 Alice Vineyard Petit Verdot (Wahluke Slope),"This is warm and loose, with fruit that is very ripe and just on the verge of pruney. The ripe fruit flavors seem to soften the tannins, which are also quite ripe and smooth. It tastes a bit like prune juice, but not unpleasantly so, with an acid base that compensates for the volatility of the finish. A drink-now wine, but it has its charms.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
4583,4584,86,Tenuta Cà Bolani NV Brut Prosecco (Italy),"There's an almond nut, herbal quality to this Prosecco Brut that gives it a broader, dusty quality. The wine is simple and light with a clear, watery feel and some peachy sweetness on the close. Fruit is sourced from the Friuli region in northeastern Italy.",Anonymous,
4584,4585,86,Domaine Alfred 2005 Estate Grenache (Edna Valley),"Soft and mouth-filling, this Central Coast Grenache offers a flood of flavors. Cherries, black raspberries, milk chocolate and vanilla flood the palate, wrapped into rich, finely ground tannins. Drink now.",Anonymous,
4585,4586,86,Leasingham 2005 Classic Clare Shiraz (Clare Valley),"Straightforward Australian Shiraz, combining mulberry fruit with vanilla oak. It lacks richness and expansiveness on the palate. A solid effort, but a bit of a disappointment given the history of the label and the suggested pricing.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4586,4587,86,Mionetto NV Sergio Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"This wine has a pretty, honey-like element to the nose that is backed by chamomile tea and dried herbs. The ensemble gives it interesting personality and a clean, fresh dimension.",Anonymous,
4587,4588,86,Montesel NV Riva dei Fiori Brut  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),"You'll appreciate the harmony and cheerful personality of this luminous Prosecco.

4588,4589,86,VinArte 2004 Alb de Murfatlar Pinot Gris (Murfatlar),"With a fresh but earthy nose of flowers, honey and herbs, this approachable white begs for food pairing. Simple but balanced and with a flirty character, it has a summer sipping kind of appeal.",Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa
4589,4590,86,Wente 2006 Morning Fog Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),"Entirely barrel-fermented in older barrels, this wine nevertheless shows plenty of buttered toast aromas to go with its tropical fruit. It's broad in the mouth, medium-bodied and turns citrusy on the finish.",Anonymous,
4590,4591,86,Winkler-Hermaden 2005 Reserve Pinot Noir (Südoststeiermark),"Lightly perfumed, this wood-aged wine has soft tannins and an unfocused character, which brings spice as well as green fruits. The aftertaste is taut and earthy.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4591,4592,86,Zonin NV Olive Garden Brut  (Prosecco del Veneto),"This is a pretty, luminous straw-colored sparkler with subtle shadings of honey, stone fruit, white flower and mineral.

4592,4593,86,Bennett Family 2006 The Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Showing true cool-climate character, this Chard brims with tropical fruit, pear, honeysuckle and smoky oaky-vanilla flavors, with a gentle scour of acids. Pretty good price for a wine this rich.",Anonymous,
4593,4594,86,Borgo San Leo NV Brut  (Prosecco del Veneto),"This sparkler made by the Zonin family opens with a crystalline appearance and offers generous aromas of stone fruit, green apple and honeysuckle. It's steely and tonic in the mouth with big, persistent effervescence.",Anonymous,
4594,4595,86,Bortolin NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"Luminous and bright, this pretty Prosecco sparkler offers steady perlage and aromas of stone fruit, acacia flower, honey and a distant note of ripe melon at the back. It's light and fresh with chewy sweet tones and the perception of less acidity.",Anonymous,
4595,4596,86,Cà Vittoria 2007 Millesimato Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),"This is a sweet, floral bubbly with mature notes of pear and peach and chewy sweetness. It has a soft, creamy texture and would pair well with salty and sweet foods alike.",Anonymous,
4596,4597,86,Cà Vittoria NV Riva dei Ciliegi Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),"Frothy and foamy, this delicately fragrant Prosecco delivers a bouquet of white flowers and orange blossom.

4597,4598,86,Caposaldo NV Brut  (Prosecco del Veneto),"Drying, dusty white stone characterizes the nose of this luminous sparkler, which is informal and fun and perfect as an aperitif. The wine segues into creamy peach, backed by thick, frosty foam.",Anonymous,
4598,4599,86,Castillo Clavijo 1998 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Leafy and peppery on the nose, with light red-fruit aromas and some citrus peel. It runs more lean and spicy than anything, with hints of tomato leaf, fennel and sausage.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4599,4600,86,Coeur d'Alene 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Washington),"These are still young vines, and showing rather simple, though attractive, fruit flavors of raspberry, strawberry and red currant. Vague hints of pepper and rock suggest good things to come, but for now this is a bit of an underachiever for the price.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
4600,4601,86,Dougos 2006 Roditis - Assyrtiko White (Thessalikos),"This flirty white is a perfect beach or patio wine, with its clean floral aromas and flavors and pronounced acidity. Balanced body and a pretty finish give it extra elegance.",Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa
4601,4602,87,Undurraga 2001 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Spicy and peppery, with lots of body and richness. In a word, it's true Carmenère. The fruit here is ripe and lush, with plenty of herbal essence, and for every drop of plum or black cherry there's a balancing hint of green herb and bell pepper, which does not signal underripeness. The finish is tight and long, with some espresso flavor. If you're interested in trying a well-made Carmenère, give this a go.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4602,4603,87,Vie di Romans 2001 Dessimis Pinot Grigio (Friuli Isonzo),"The name of the wine is an old word used to measure fields, and reflects the Gallo (no connection with the California winery) family's use of traditional ideas and techniques at Vie de Romans. This wine has full, ripe fruit, soft and with layers of attractive wood and vanilla flavors.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4603,4604,87,Villa Russiz 2001 Sauvignon de la Tour Sauvignon Blanc (Collio),"If you enjoy a really pungent, intensely grassy Sauvignon, then you'll love this wine, but for many consumers it will be too much. The descriptor “cat pee” may sound unkind, but it's apropos in this case, balanced by passion fruit and a long, lemony finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4604,4605,86,Montes 2000 Alpha Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley),"Big and ripe, with cola, root beer and berry aromas along with rich oak. The palate is a high-wire act of bright red fruit combined with thick milk chocolate and malt. The tannins and acidity allow the wine to be aggressive, maybe too much so given that the fruit is somewhat tart and prickly.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4605,4606,86,Montes 2001 Oak Aged - Reserve Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"Simple and clean up front, with inviting aromas. The mouth on this wine is broad and satisfying, and the flavors of plum, blackberry, black olive and buttery oak work in tandem. The finish is a bit aggressive, and here the oak is powerful as it leaves a bitter lasting sensation. But overall the wine impresses for its solidity and full fruit.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4606,4607,86,Masi 2002 Classico  (Soave),"An easy, full-flavored wine, with crisp, clean fruit, flavors of almonds and a touch of soft,ripeness.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4607,4608,86,Morandé 2002 Vitisterra Grand Reserve Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Fairly forward, with aromas of lemon curd and the insides of many oak barrels. In the mouth are the full allotment of pear, apple and lemon flavors, while the finish sits down and dries out rather nicely. Tasty and refreshing, with just enough heft.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4608,4609,86,San Pedro 2001 Castillo de Molina Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Lontué Valley),"A bit of complexity dances across the bouquet: there's rubber, wood, anisette and mute red fruit; there's also some minty green aromas, too. The palate is properly round and buttery, with ample red-fruit flavors, while the finish is smooth and mostly satisfying. This is a basic Cabernet, but a good one.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4609,4610,86,Concha y Toro 2001 Xplorador Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Everything about this mass-market Chard works. The nose has some pleasant nectarine and apricot aromas, while the mouth is racy and lively, and loaded with mango, pear and honeydew flavors. The finish is fruity, if a tad sweet. Nevertheless it's fresh and clean, and it leaves a good lasting impression. Anyone who likes a sweeter-styled white will fancy this. Best Buy.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4610,4611,86,Elena Walch 2002 Castel Ringberg Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"A light, crisp style that hints at spice but shows delicious fresh fruit. The acidity shows through, giving a vibrant character to the fruit.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4611,4612,86,La Palma 2002 Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Cachapoal Valley),"Simple, open and ready to drink. The nose is floral, with hints of fresh pear.

4612,4613,86,Calina 2001 Reserve Merlot (Maule Valley),"The nose is standard fare as it offers cherry, plum and a hint of herbaceousness. Good plum and berry fruit carries the mouth, while the finish is round and smooth. The wine is balanced and entirely satisfying even if it is basic in its intent. As per usual, Calina delivers a good wine for the price. -M.S.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4613,4614,86,Testarossa 2001 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Lots of flavor packed into this light-bodied, smoothly textured wine, although it's a bit one-dimensional. Flavors veer toward raspberry cola and lots of dusty, peppery spices, wrapped in silky tannins and boosted by crisp acids.",Anonymous,
4614,4615,86,Tiefenbrunner 2002 Kirchleiten Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige),"This wine from the Tiefenbrunner estate at Castel Turmhof is a lively, crisp, fresh style of wine, with flavors of green peppers and mint, and good acidity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

4616,4617,86,La Vis 2000 Maso Roncador Müller-Thurgau (Trentino),"Smells of honey and lychee fruit, but without the bold exuberance of Gewürztraminer. Pear flavors the midpalate, then turns citrusy on the finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4617,4618,86,Imagery 2000 Artist Collection White Burgundy White (California),"Explosively fruity, with big, bold flavors of peaches, pears, apples, tropical fruits, you name it. Drinks firmly dry, although oak brings a wood-sap sweetness. Lees aging was significant and adds a sour cream note. A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc.",Anonymous,
4618,4619,86,La Palma 2002 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Cachapoal Valley),"Very forward and young, with an overt, grapey style. This wine doesn't walk lightly, as it starts out more positive than it finishes. The plum, cassis and berry fruit is really ripe and active, but there's also some aggressive acidity that makes it more tangy and sharp than ideal.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4619,4620,85,Wagner 2008 Semi Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"On the nose, this is a bit unique, offering unusual scents of pineapple, baked apple and white florals. Just slightly off-dry with loads of sweet, fresh apple flavors and a brisk, lemony acidity, the finish ends on an elegant jasmine tea note.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
4620,4621,85,Oxford Landing 2008 GSM Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre Red (South Australia),"This blend of 45% Grenache, 28% Shiraz and 27% Mourvèdre does show a trace of heat in its finish, but is otherwise a pleasant, medium-bodied sipper at a realistic price. Tart, slightly minty cherries feature undercurrents of chocolate and coffee, turning crisp and lemony on the finish. Drink now.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4621,4622,85,Pricum 2007 Valdemuz Prieto Picudo (Tierra de León),"Medicinal, sweet and short on complexity for a wine of this price. The palate has a choppy, rough feel and then comes an onslaught of medicinal berry flavor that leads to a tight, biting finish that's big on acid and low on depth of flavor and intracacies you might expect for $80. More of a novelty wine; 160 cases made.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4622,4623,85,Tarara 2008 Charval White Table Wine White (Virginia),"Apples and pears dominate the nose and palate of this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris.

4623,4624,85,Murphy-Goode 2008 Liar's Dice Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"A soft, simple but pretty wine, with slightly sweet, pie-filling cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola and baking spice flavors. Drink now.",Anonymous,
4624,4625,85,Barrel Oak 2008 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Virginia),"Hints of freshly pressed apples and pears in a darkly toasted oak barrel come through.

The finish is clean and lemony with a slight saline touch.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
4625,4626,85,Concha y Toro 2009 Xplorador Chardonnay (Central Valley),"Quiet on the bouquet except for a dusting of oak and banana. The palate is heavy and wide, if a bit flabby, and the flavors of melon and mango run sweet, much like fruit punch. Soft and sweet on the finish as well, and overall it's good but generic. Not many Chards in the price range will fare better.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4626,4627,85,Coquelicot 2007 Mon Amour Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"This Bordeaux blend is a little rough around the edges. It has a sharp, jammy feeling, and seems too sweet in raspberry- and cherry-pie filling. Will appeal to fans of an easy drinking, accessible style of a Cabernet-based wine.",Anonymous,
4627,4628,85,Wagner 2008 Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Although subdued both aromatically and on the palate, this refreshing, dry Gewürztraminer smells sweetly of waxy white florals and lemons with a hint of bruised apples. There's not a lot of concentration of flavor, but its fresh apple and lemon flavors are clean and brisk, ending with a pleasant grapefruit pith finish.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
4628,4629,85,William Cole 2010 Albamar Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Sweaty and sharp on the nose, with punchy, oily, green aromas. The palate is wet and basic in feel, with nettle, grapefruit and passionfruit flavors. Good in terms of core qualities but not all that intense or layered. A basic wine for general consumption.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

4630,4631,85,Mazzi 2008 Sanperetto  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),"Thin, informal and packed tight with crisp wild berry flavors, this bright Valpolicella will slice through fatty or cheesy dishes. In the mouth, it shows an easy, no-fuss approach with a citrus twist on the fade.",Anonymous,
4631,4632,85,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2009 Colheita Red (Douro),"An attractive, fruity, unoaked wine. It reveals red berry fruits, light acidity and a fine, firm tannic concentration. To drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4632,4633,85,Ochoa 2008 Garnacha-Tempranillo Red (Navarra),"Hefty and rubbery on the bouquet, with black-fruit aromas and some dustiness.

Comes up a bit short and hollow on the finish, but good all totaled.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4633,4634,85,Perception 2007 Bacigalupi Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Starts with a funky smell that doesn't go away despite lots of airing.

4635,4636,87,Wine Guerrilla 2010 Mounts Vineyard Cypress Block Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"High alcohol gives this Zin some jalapeño-like heat.

4637,4638,87,Pessagno 2010 Idyll Times Syrah (San Benito County),"This treads the line between slightly rustic and refined. The tannins are sandpapery, and it has lots of zingy acidity, making the wine feel a little rough. But the core of blackberry fruit is rich and dynamic. Probably not an ager, so give it a good decanting, and drink it over the next 2–3 years.",Anonymous,

4667,4668,88,José Maria da Fonseca 2010 José de Sousa Red (Alentejano),This is an earthy wine that packs ripe fruit with structure and acidity. There is a juicy character from the red berry flavor that is given shape by the underlying tannins.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
4668,4669,88,Witness Tree 2010 Vintage Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Though it was given twice as many new French oak barrels as the Estate bottling, this Vintage Select could be its twin. Solid and balanced, it mixes berry, herb and earth components, making for a well-structured, no-frills wine.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
4669,4670,86,David Girard 2010 Estate Vineyard Mourvèdre (El Dorado),"Oaky and earthy, this estate Mourvèdre is on the savory side of things, ripe in stewed plums, tobacco and black pepper, linear and soft. Barrel-aged for a year in French oak, 20% of it new, the wine's oak imprint should continue to mellow with time.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
4670,4671,86,Eleven 2012 Elephant Mountain Vineyard Roussanne (Yakima Valley),"Whole-cluster pressed, with 20% Marsanne in the blend, this displays fresh fruit flavors of apple and pear, with a bit of somewhat dilute green banana. There's a slightly waxy aspect to the mouthfeel; overall this is a simple, pleasant, clean but generic white wine.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
4671,4672,86,Elsom Cellars 2008 Isabella Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The prune and raisin scents and flavors suggest that some of these grapes were picked past optimal ripeness. For those who favor an almost Port-like style, this Bordeaux-style blend will hit the mark. The finish suggests figs lightly splashed with balsamic vinegar.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
4672,4673,85,One Woman 2010 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"Crème caramel and spice aromas are exotically appealing on this bright, full-bodied Chardonnay.

4673,4674,85,Sannino 2010 Prima Rossa Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Brambly red berry and sour cherry notes are fleshy and ripe in this brawny, full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend. It's unabashedly primary in style with soft, plushy texture. Finishes with a bit of heat.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
4674,4675,85,Bonacchi 2009 Molino della Suga  (Brunello di Montalcino),"In this one-dimensional wine, short-lived sensations of stewed black fruit quickly give way to acrid notes of unsweetened espresso, farmyard, sweat and green coffee beans alongside rough, grainy tannins. A bitterly tannic close leaves the tongue feeling parched.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
4675,4676,85,Michael Pozzan 2012 Annabella Special Selection Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"New oak dominates this Chardonnay, giving it strong flavors of buttered toast and butterscotch. The acidity is pronounced, and there are ripe mango and pear flavors, but it remains a simple wine.",Anonymous,
4676,4677,85,Pacific Rim 2012 Wallula Vineyard Biodynamic Riesling (Horse Heaven Hills),"Starting off quite reductive, it opens to reveal notes of lime leaf, mineral and freshly peeled tangerine.

4677,4678,85,Parducci 2010 Small Lot Blend Petite Sirah (Mendocino County),A good-value Petite Sirah that's straightforward in texture and personality. Its blueberry fruit lurks shyly in the background and there's a send-off of sturdy tannin on the finish.,Virginie Boone,@vboone

4680,4681,85,Silver Thread 2012 Doyle East Seneca Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Whiffs of smoke and dust add a savory tone to delicate flavors of apple and honeydew rind on this dry, zesty wine. It's medium bodied on the palate with refreshing lemon-lime acidity.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
4681,4682,85,Summerwood 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This Cab, ripe as it is in cherries, black currants and dark chocolate, nonetheless is too soft in structure. It has a melted mouthfeel. The finish suggests caramelized wood. Drink up.",Anonymous,

4684,4685,85,Raimat 2012 Castell de Raimat Albariño (Costers del Segre),"Melon and white-fruit aromas are more generic than specific.

4685,4686,85,Oak Valley 2005 The Oak Valley Blend Red (Elgin),"Spiced meat, tomato leaf and stemmy black fruit overwhelm this wine, which might unfortunately be a bit past its prime. 69% Merlot, 27% Cabernet Franc and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
4686,4687,85,Emiliana 2009 Natura Merlot (Rapel Valley),"Fairly hard on the nose, with a hint of plastic and then raspberry and plum aromas rising as it settles.

4687,4688,85,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2009 Villa Beaurivage White (Vin de France),"A blend of typical Gascon grapes gives a lemon and citrus wine, very fresh, tangy. There is plenty of acidity and an attractive lightness. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4688,4689,85,Somerston 2009 Highflyer Grenache Blanc (Napa Valley),"A good, everyday sipper, soft and gentle, with appealing flavors of pineapples, oranges, pears, cream and buttered toast. Could show greater structure and acidity.",Anonymous,
4689,4690,85,Amalie Robert 2008 Vintage Debut Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Light and delicate, this “Vintage Debut” Pinot Noir skates along a pretty thin edge. Light hints of strawberry and cherry blossom lead into a pale wine with plenty of acidity. But despite the acclaimed vintage, this is pretty thin stuff.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
4690,4691,85,Barton & Guestier 2008 Les Charmes de Magnol  (Médoc),"Confusingly, the wine has no connection with Château Magnol, also owned by Barton & Guestier. It's a soft Médoc wine, light and gentle in character, the tannins soft, merging with the red berry fruits.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4691,4692,85,Drei Donà Tenuta La Palazza 2009 Rosenere Red (Forlì),This easy food wine (a blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon) offers aromas of wild berry and white almond. There's a nice balance between crispness and a touch of sweetness on the close.,Anonymous,
4692,4693,85,Baldassari Family Wines 2007 Nolan Vineyards Syrah (Bennett Valley),"Soft, sweet in jammy raspberry and cherry fruit and caramelized oak, this Syrah is somewhat simple. It's good, but would benefit from greater structure.",Anonymous,
4693,4694,85,Barton & Guestier 2007 Thomas Barton Réserve  (Margaux),"A wine that offers plenty of the charm of Margaux, with its soft tannins, layers of chocolate, smooth texture and juicy fruit. The wood at this stage is prominent, and needs to settle down.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4694,4695,85,Borra 2008 47.5 Degree Limited Release Syrah Syrah (Clements Hills),"Jammy and yet still savory, a fairly straightforward Syrah from the Clements Hills area of Lodi, small production (240 cases), 100% varietal and made using native fermentation, the wine has solid tannin structure and a heady texture, but could use more oomph on the finish.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
4695,4696,85,Botalcura 2006 Cayao Red (Central Valley),"Rather hard and baked on the nose, with a heavy helping of char and molasses. The palate is angular and tannic, while the flavors revolve around lemony oak and spice more than fruit. Spiky on the finish and sharp-edged as a whole. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Malbec and Syrah.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

4697,4698,85,Chilensis 2009 Reserva Malbec (Maule Valley),"Purple in color, with grapey aromas that lack complexity.

Syrupy but generous.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4698,4699,85,Domaine des Baumard 2006 La Calèche Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Vin de Pays du Jardin de la France),"With its few years' aging, the wine exhibits a Chenin Blanc nutty quality backed by the greater weight of Chardonnay. Full-bodied, ready to drink. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4699,4700,85,Donelan 2008 Cuvée Moriah Grenache-Syrah (Sonoma County),"Not in the same league as Donelan's Syrahs. The Grenache seems to drag it down. It's paler in color, there's a vegetal smell, and it's simple in berry, cola and spice flavors. Drink now.",Anonymous,

4701,4702,83,Bodegas Valdemar 2003 Inspiración Edición Limitada  (Rioja),"The palate is big and cushioned, but the flavors are green, stewy and herbal. With carob and some veggies on the finish, there isn't convincing ripeness to this wine.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4702,4703,83,Campo Viejo 2003 Reserva  (Rioja),"Strawberry, red plum and a strong hint of tomato leaf work the nose, followed by tangy raspberry flavors and a wash of acidity. Seems sort of scratchy and edgy, with a hard, dry peppery quality.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4703,4704,83,Casa Nuestra 2007 Home Vineyard Dry Rosado Rosé (Napa Valley),"St. Helena is the source of this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Entirely unoaked, it's a dry, crisp, rustic wine, and full-bodied for a rosé, with heavy flavors of cherry pie filling.",Anonymous,
4704,4705,83,Valsanzo 2005 Viña Sanzo Verdejo (Rueda),"Yellow in color, with floral, citrusy aromas. Not a whole lot of definition to the palate; it's wet but dilute, with unrefined, nonproprietary citrus flavors.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4705,4706,83,Bodegas Julián Chivite 2004 Gran Feudo Crianza Red (Navarra),"Tightly wound and acidic, with forceful red-berry flavors that are spicy and zesty.

4706,4707,83,Bodegas Monte La Reina 2005 Torcanto Roble  (Toro),"Roble means “oak” in Spanish, and oaky it is.

4707,4708,83,Señorío de Sarria 2004 Viñedo No. 9 Cabernet Sauvignon (Navarra),"Hard and mossy, and not bearing much resemblance to Cabernet as we know it.

4708,4709,83,Hemar 2006 Joven  (Ribera del Duero),"Condensed up front, with aromas of berry compote and molasses. So why is this so tangy and tart in the mouth? Maybe the grapes weren't as ripe as they seem from the nose, and in the end it fails the all-important balance/wholesomeness test.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4709,4710,82,Finca Antigua 2006 Blanco Viura (La Mancha),"Zingy and sort of floral on the nose, but fairly pickled, less than pure fruit mars the flavor profile. White wine from La Mancha has never been a Spanish strong suit, and while this wine isn't cloying, sharp or dead on arrival, it doesn't add up to much.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4710,4711,82,Bodegas Valdemar 2006 Esencia Valdemar  (Rioja),"Gumball aromas yield to scents of spice and wet animal fur, while the flavor profile settles on tart and thin, with a watery mouthfeel. This is a lean, funky wine that doesn't have a whole lot of Rioja character.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4711,4712,82,Hayman & Hill 2005 Reserve Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A little rough around the edges, with some green tannins and minty, herbal flavors. You get some candied cherries and currants, but the wine is pretty rustic.",Anonymous,
4712,4713,82,Conn Creek 2004 Conn Creek Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A brittle, peppery and ultimately disappointing wine, this 100% varietal lacks the smoothness and cherry-herb complexities you expect from a fine Rutherford Cab. Finishes sharp and dry.",Anonymous,
4713,4714,87,H. Blin NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"A soft, ripe rosé, this is on the sweeter side of brut. It also has a flavor of bottle maturity that blends easily with attractive crisp acidity and a fragrant rose hip character. It is ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4714,4715,87,Miguel Torres NV Santa Digna Estelado Rosé Sparkling (Chile),"Wheaty and yeasty on the nose, this becomes clearer and more focused on the palate and finish.

4715,4716,87,Morandé 2008 Edición Limitada Carignan (Loncomilla Valley),"Edgy plum and berry aromas come with an herb accent, a spice note and a flower element.

4716,4717,87,Orion Wine 2010 Rocca del Dragone Falanghina (Campania),"This fragrant Falanghina shows bright aromas of white flower, jasmine and honeysuckle. Very subtle tones of banana and pineapple fill in the back and give the wine momentum and depth on the finish.",Anonymous,

4719,4720,87,Spann Vineyards 2010 Betsy's Backacher White (California),"On its own, this is dry and earthy, with a taste of Middle Eastern hummus, apricots and oranges. It's certainly offbeat, but it can certainly be paired with food. How about hummus with teriyaki salmon?",Anonymous,
4720,4721,87,Telavi 2008 Satrapezo Saperavi (Kakheti),"A rich, earthy mushroom note adds a rustic flair to this dark, ripe, full-bodied red.

4731,4732,87,Quinta do Quetzal 2008 Guadalupe Tinto Red (Alentejano),"This is an oak-aged wine full of ripe red-plum and highly toasted wood flavors. The two do not yet completely harmonize, with the burnt wood still dominating the fruit. Another year should do the trick.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4732,4733,87,Quinta do Quetzal 2010 Guadalupe Tinto Red (Alentejano),"Firm and obviously wood aged, this has a red plum flavor and some bitterness from the highly toasted wood. It has richness and spice; aging may soften the wood character.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4733,4734,87,René Geoffroy NV Blanc de Rosé Extra Brut  (Champagne),"Despite its name, this is in fact a rosé, which is light orange-pink in color. It is bone dry, mineral, taut and crisp.

4736,4737,84,Golan Heights Winery 2009 Yarden T2 Touriga Nacional-Tinta Cao Red (Galilee),"If blackberry preserves and black licorice were made into a wine, this would be it. While Yarden's T2 dry blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Cao is a very good wine, this sweet Port-style wine misses the mark. With a nose of blackberry preserves, cassis and rose petal—and flavors of blackberry, cassis, licorice and clove—it should be gorgeous in the mouth. However, the overall sweetness is cloying without necessary balance.",Mike DeSimone,@worldwineguys
4737,4738,83,Vin du Lac 2010 Barrel Select Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"There is no varietal specificity to be found in this 100% Cabernet Franc.

4742,4743,83,Shalestone 2013 Beyond Rosé (Finger Lakes),"Ruby in color yet delicate in extract, this blend of Zweigelt and Lemberger is a concession between a red and rosé wine.

4743,4744,83,Bodegas Ateca 2012 Honoro Vera Garnacha (Calatayud),"Tarry, stalky aromas fail to make much of a statement. This is high in acid and rugged in the mouth, with a mixture of herbal red-fruit flavors and distinct stalkiness. A grating finish is racy and hot.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

4746,4747,83,Savannah-Chanelle 2010 Estate Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Pipe tobacco, raspberry reduction and a sweet sagebrush character promise an interesting experience. Once sipped, the overwhelmingly sweet cherry, cough-syrup flavor pushes this wine beyond a dry, and the typical Cabernet Franc herbs that emerge in the midpalate don't overwhelm its cloying nature.

4753,4754,90,Ribafreixo 2016 Connections Chenin Blanc (Portuguese Table Wine),"Well, who thought Chenin Blanc would end up in the Alentejo? Obviously not the guardian of the wine rules, which is why this classified as a mere table wine.

4759,4760,90,Sleeping Giant 2014 Buena Tierra Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"With its inviting apple blossom aromas, this wine is fleshy and bright, showing balance and complexity from start to lengthy finish.

4766,4767,90,Adega Mãe 2013 Terroir Branco White (Lisboa),This is a ripe wood-aged wine that has a smooth rich texture. It is rounded with dominant toastiness as well as perfumed fruit.

4767,4768,90,Alma Rosa 2014 Mt. Eden Clone El Jabali Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Earthy iron, game and thyme aromas decorate the core of pomegranate fruit in this California heritage clonal selection from the Sanford family's home vineyard.

4771,4772,90,Chehalem 2014 Ridgecrest Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"Flavors roll from cranberry to sweet red cherry in a red-fruit riot. It was aged in 52% new and 24% one-year-old oak, but it's unobtrusive and not especially toasty. The barrel time has begun to smooth out any bumps and rough edges, though a touch of phenolic bite remains. Drink from 2018 to 2022.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

4773,4774,90,Clos du Val 2015 Gran Val Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Made in a full-bodied and fleshy style, this comes from an estate vineyard long owned by the producer.

4774,4775,90,Domaine François Schmitt 2014 Pfingstberg Grand Cru Paradis Riesling (Alsace),"Lemon notes are subdued by earth on the nose but they shine on a rather textured, palate that needs some air to open up. There is concentration at the core and generous freshness that lights up everything. Subtle but totally worthwhile with a clean lemon finish.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
4775,4776,90,Domaine Martin 2014 Les Trois Versants Vieilles Vignes Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"The wine is rich and concentrated for a Muscadet.

4776,4777,90,Dr. Hermann 2014 H Riesling (Mosel),"Swirls of penetrating peach and honey flavors pack a mighty punch in this dazzling, sunny sip.

Drink through 2020.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
4780,4781,90,Thorn Clarke 2013 Shotfire Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Barossa),"Firmly tannic, this is the rare example of a lower-priced wine that deserves some time in the cellar. There's a sense of coolness and restraint to this wine at first. Hints of menthol lift scents of mixed berries, then develop on the palate into sturdy, chewy fruit flavors and mocha. Drink 2018–2030.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4781,4782,90,Alvarez de Toledo 2013 Roble Mencía (Bierzo),"Ripe plum and violet aromas carry a slight note of prune. A beefy palate shows hard tannins but nothing too tough that food can't tame.

4784,4785,90,Mr. Riggs 2013 Generation Series Mrs. Viognier (Adelaide),"This is less opulent and full bodied than most Australian Viogniers, but it still delivers an attractive blend of white peaches, citrus and baking spices. It's crisp and bright enough on the finish to handle a wide range of seafood dishes. Drink now.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4785,4786,90,Hirsch 2012 East Ridge Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Complex and fascinating aromas suggesting cranberry, cedar and mushroom get your attention right away. Next a tight, firmly tannic texture takes over and seems to hold on to the fruit flavors. The wine is light to medium in body, and seems likely to let its flavors out after 2019.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
4786,4787,90,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2013 Furstentum Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Faintly spiced, ripe apple and pear notes on the nose are mellowed by gentle, barely-there sweetness on the palate.

4787,4788,90,Chateau Grand Traverse 2013 Dry Riesling (Old Mission Peninsula),"Established in the early 70s by Ed O'Keefe Jr., this Michigan winery remains in the family to this day and maintains the founding father's focus on producing wines from 100% vinifera grapes in a region where hybrids might be the easier option. Perseverance pays off in this delightfully balanced dry Riesling that seamlessly blends juicy peach, pineapple rind and a vein of talc-dusted citrus. Texturally round and soft, with a peach-fuzz feel, this is a veritable steal for the price.",Alexander Peartree,
4788,4789,90,Dobbes Family Estate 2012 Fortmiller Vineyard Syrah (Rogue Valley),"This fascinating wine comes from one of Oregon's highest vineyards, which grow at 2,000 feet.

4789,4790,90,Domaine Charles Frey 2012 Frankstein Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Mellow, rounded and ripe notes of fresh and baked apples promise a rich wine. The palate is more sprightly and lends plenty of gingery, peppery spice to all the abundant apple fruit. This is wired and lively, dry but very fruity and unusually spicy with a fine backbone of bright, lemony freshness. Drink soon.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
4790,4791,90,Domaine Gresser 2014 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),Rich perfumes reach the nose: quince and baked apple give a seductive tone.

4791,4792,90,Domaines Schlumberger 2011 Cuvée Christine Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"With time, fresh rose petals merge into heady Turkish delight notes on the nose. This is full-on Gewurztraminer with all the bells and whistles: utterly decadent rose water and honeysuckle notes are submerged in rich, indulgent sweetness. This is perfumed and full-on: a super-charged varietal expression with rich, powdery layers of rose, honey and caramel.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
4792,4793,90,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos 2011 Amantis Reserva Red (Alentejano),"Named after the mistress of Portugual's King João V who lived at this estate, the wine is a super-ripe expression of the warmth of an Alentejo wine.

4794,4795,90,Dr. Loosen 2014 Dr. L Dry Riesling (Mosel),"Juicy streaks of grapefruit and pineapple in this spry, dry Riesling are cut by laser-focused acidity and rocky edges of slate. It's approachable and fresh yet abundantly elegant. Drink now through 2018.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
4795,4796,90,Fitapreta 2013 Baga ao Sol Baga (Alentejano),"This is an unexpected wine, unoaked Baga in the Alentejo rather than its home territory of Bairrada. The result is a wine that certainly hasn't lost its fierce tannins while gaining a rich, full black fruit character. The typical acidity is there, again mitigated by the warmer climate away from the ocean. It's a surprisingly impressive wine to drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4796,4797,84,Cennatoio 1995 O'Leandro Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Tart berries, a touch of maple syrup and some orange peel on the nose open into a dry black-cherry palate and lean mouthfeel. Sharply austere.",Anonymous,
4797,4798,83,Hargrave NV Chardonette/White Blend Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"A blended white, but predominantly—you guessed it—Chardonnay. The soft, sweet pear aromas and flavors are simple and clean, making this a decent quaffer on a hot summer day.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4798,4799,83,Piccini 1997 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"The red cherry fruit bears some mushroom notes among the cedar and clove accents, and there's a sense of hollowing-out that should not be evidenced at this age. It's light, showing some nice berry and spice flavors and a sweet woodiness. But it's too developed now for a 1997 riserva.",Anonymous,
4799,4800,83,Carmel 1999 Valley Wines Petite Sirah (Shomron),"Opens with solid grape and red-currant fruit accented by tobacco, but on the palate the wine is light for a Petite Sirah, usually a hefty wine. As the fruit is from very young vines, it's not a terrible surprise, and it's a positive sign that Israeli winemakers are stretching their horizons. Finishes tart-sweet, with red berry fruit and a hint of licorice.",Anonymous,
4800,4801,83,Hargrave NV Fleurette Rosé (North Fork of Long Island),"A lightweight Pinot that's actually marketed as a rosé, this wine nevertheless manages to pack in decent flavors of apple skin, red berries and cinnamon, capped off by some leathery, meaty notes.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz

4802,4803,83,Castello di Borghese NV Petit Chateau Red (North Fork of Long Island),"A lightweight bordeaux style blend that's best slightly chilled as a stand-in for Beaujolais or Bourgeuil.  Berry fruit, with some light tannins that turn a bit green on the finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4803,4804,83,Giacomo Mori 1998 Castelrotto  (Chianti),"As much as we like the retro package, this time the contents are just too one-dimensional. The heavily toasted oak over the narrow fruit from the '98 vintage reads as just that—toast, with vanilla and coconut shadings. Dry powdery tannins mark the taut finish.",Anonymous,
4804,4805,83,Abarbanel 1999 Estate Bottled Syrah (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"Bright cherry and cedary aromas open to a soft mouthfeel and tart blackberry flavors with black toast shadings. The dark flavors and light mouthfeel are a bit out of sync, as if the flavor range demands more weight on the palate. Tart black fruits show on the finish.",Anonymous,
4805,4806,83,Valiano 1995 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Looking brown around the edges, this wine is showing decline at an age when a good riserva should be hitting full stride. The fruit is stylishly sweet, but attenuated, and past its best in this pretty, older wine. Fading elegance, but why at just past five years of age?",Anonymous,
4806,4807,83,Castellare 1996 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Shows unexpected age, with brown around the edges and mature prune and orange-peel aromas. The flavors are more alive, but are not vibrant. Rather dull on the finish, this isn't bad wine but tastes like something four or five years older.",Anonymous,

4808,4809,83,Palmer 1998 Estate Pinot Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"Ripe melons and pears dance a delicate duet on the palate—softly and gently shifting ever so slightly from honeydew to Bosc and back, before turning lean and citrusy on the finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4809,4810,83,Macari 1998 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"There's some light toast and vanilla flavors layered over modest Bosc-pear fruit, but a lack of intensity holds this wine back despite a generous mouthfeel and ample structure.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz

4811,4812,83,Paumanok 2000 Semi Dry Riesling (North Fork of Long Island),"Starts off with aromas of apple blossoms and ultraripe pears. The pear notes carry through on the palate, where they're joined by a touch of anise. This slightly sweet bottling pales in comparison to Paumanok's Dry Riesling, but offers a well-made, soft alternative.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
4812,4813,83,Castellani 1997 Riserva  (Chianti),"The cherry aromas and flavors here already have an aged quality. Some nice spicy accents conspire to keep it alive, but it closes rather tart and woody. Doesn't show the depth expected in a riserva.",Anonymous,

4819,4820,88,Centovigne 2015 Miranda Erbaluce,"Made with 100% native grape Erbaluce, this offers delicate aromas and flavors of ripe pear, green apple and citrus. A salty mineral note closes the crisp, clean finish.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
4820,4821,88,Château de Lionne 2015 L'Envolée de Lionne  (Bordeaux),"While there are plenty of wood flavors here, the wine also has fine ripe blackberries. That gives potential balance and density. This fine wine will be ready to drink from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

4822,4823,88,San Biagio 2013 Capalot  (Barolo),"Truffle, dried herb, espresso, new leather and balsamic aromas come together on this along with a whiff of wood shop.

4825,4826,88,Sparkman 2014 Outlaw Merlot (Yakima Valley),"This wine is a blend of fruit from Obelisco, Olsen, Oasis and Kiona vineyards. Wood-forward aromas (60% new French oak) of char and coffee are out in front of herb and black cherry. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied, pulling up short on the finish. There's enjoyment to be had but the variety seems hard to find.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport

4827,4828,88,Tempus Cellars 2013 Dionysus Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine all comes from Block 18 at this esteemed vineyard.

4828,4829,88,Terras Gauda 2014 La Mar White (Rías Baixas),"This chunky, funky blend is led by the local Caiño Blanco grape, with Loureiro and Albariño in the mix.

Sullivan,@wawinereport

4864,4865,94,Domaine de Bellene 2014 Les Suchots Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),"This Premier Cru abuts some of the grandest Grand Crus of Burgundy.

4872,4873,95,Alain Brumont 2006 Château Bouscassé Vieilles Vignes Tannat (Madiran),"Some vines at Bouscassé are 150 years old, which inevitably give this wine great depth and concentration.

4875,4876,94,De Loach 2009 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Pinot Noir just doesn't get richer than this. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of raspberries and cherries, with fascinatingly earthy things, like truffles and pine cones.

4876,4877,94,Alain Brumont 2007 Château Montus Tannat-Cabernet Franc (Madiran),"This legendary Madiran is, its fruit tannins just softened by wood aging. It's smoky, brooding, very concentrated, and worth aging for 10 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4877,4878,94,Bergström 2009 de Lancellotti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"A concentrated core of pure, sweet raspberry and cherry fruit is showcased in a wine of remarkable penetration and length. The fruit, from a biodynamic estate vineyard, is perfumed and open, making this immediately accessible and supremely enjoyable. And yet cellaring will surely reward those with the patience and discipline to lay it down for up to a decade.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
4878,4879,94,Couloir 2010 Monument Tree Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"The vineyard has been source to Pinot Noirs from Copain and Drew, and this one, from Winemaker Jon Grant shows a somewhat Cabernet-esque interpretation. The wine is dark, tannic and medium-bodied, and quite extracted in the flashily ripe cherry and cola fruit that Monument Tree ripens so well in a cool, long hangtime year like 2010. Despite the richness, this is an elegant, ageworthy wine, whose low alcohol will delight many who critique California Pinot Noir for clumsiness. Give it at least six years in a good cellar.",Anonymous,
4879,4880,94,De Loach 2009 Nova Vineyard Zinfandel (Lake County),"De Loach reaches into Lake County, not usually thought of as Zinfandel country, with tremendous results. This is a great wine by any standard. It shows some heat from high alcohol and some shriveled raisin tastes, but that's part of a ripe Zin's charm. Mostly, you'll be impressed by waves of sweetly ripe berries, chocolate and bacon, smooth tannins and a long, spicy finish.",Anonymous,
4880,4881,94,Niepoort 1986 Colheita  (Port),"Gold in color, this is a wood-aged Port. Despite being 26 years old, it is still lively, almost fruity.

Like all Colheitas, it is ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4881,4882,94,Raymond 2008 Generations Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"So rich and ripe in fruit, you almost don't notice that it's also a complicated and layered wine in structure. Blackberry marmalade, cassis and cocoa flavors are balanced despite hefty alcohol. An extraordinarily delicious wine, but it's meant to be enjoyed in its youth. Drink up by 2016.",Anonymous,
4882,4883,94,Fonseca NV 20 Year Old Tawny  (Port),"A gorgeous Port at that right stage where there is still freshness and hints of orange and dried fruits, while the wood aging is concentrating the wine into its essence. It is rich, full, yet at the same time has a great tang of spirit and acidity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4883,4884,94,Frazier 2008 Memento Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A vastly concentrated Cabernet. Frazier seems to have taken their basic Cabernet, which is an excellent wine, and intensified everything about it. With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy. The alcohol is very high, and we do not know how these modern Cabernets will ride out the years.",Anonymous,
4884,4885,94,Herdade do Esporão 2008 TN Touriga Nacional (Alentejano),"A superb example of the quality of Touriga Nacional.

4885,4886,94,Round Pond 2008 Reserve Bovet Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Extraordinarily ripe and sweet in blackberries, cassis and figs, with a lovely perfume of violets and cedar, this soft, lush Cabernet, which was blended with some Petit Verdot, is so decadent now, you can hardly resist it. But it's pretty tannic, with good acidity, and has the structure to ride out the next eight years.",Anonymous,
4886,4887,94,Obsidian Ridge 2009 Half Mile Red (Red Hills Lake County),"The winery doesn't reveal on the label what grape varieties are in this blend, but they're Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. It's a fine, delicious wine, with blackberry, dark chocolate and bacon flavors, wrapped into exceedingly fine tannins. It's well-balanced, too, with moderate alcohol and a nice lick of acids. Impressive and classy from this Lake County winery.",Anonymous,
4887,4888,94,Niepoort 1984 Colheita  (Port),"Now that the color of this superb wine has gone to old gold, it has definitely become a gloriously mature Port. The color translates into sweetness, which is allied to acidity, richness and an immense intensity due to its long wood aging.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
4888,4889,94,Raymond 2008 District Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A superb wine, showing real Oakville character. It's bone dry, rich and complex in tannin structure, with wonderfully ripe blackberry and cassis flavors. Yet there's a minerality that anchors the wine, and the finish is long, smooth and spicy. Just delicious now, and should hold over the next six years.",Anonymous,

4891,4892,94,Ken Wright 2010 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A marvelous vintage for Freedom Hill, this high-acid Pinot is loaded with black cherry fruit. Rich, ripe, full, tart and penetrating, it might seem one-dimensional at first, but it has such excellent focus and depth that the fruit simply rocks. The finish weaves in threads of smoke and mocha, but this is a wine to cellar for a couple more years at least.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
4892,4893,94,Domaine Serene 2008 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Dark, full, generous and ripe to the far edge of elegance, this powerful Pinot is saturated with black fruits, annotated with fennel, pepper, smoke and espresso, the rich and varied flavors rolling right through a lush midpalate and on into a gently fading finish. Retasted over 24–48 hours, it continued to evolve and develop additional nuances. A wine to cellar for a decade or more.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
4893,4894,94,Feudi di San Gregorio 2004 Piano di Montevergine Riserva  (Taurasi),"This vineyard-designate Taurasi Riserva is probably one of the biggest, boldest wines produced in Italy.

4895,4896,93,Sodaro 2008 Estate Red (Napa Valley),"The majority Cab Sauvignon in the blend brings classic blackberry and cassis flavors, as well as firm tannins.

5258,5259,88,Bruno Paillard NV Première Cuvée Extra Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"A pale-colored rosé, fresh and very dry, this is crisp and light. Attractive raspberry and red currant fruits are cut by acidity. The tangy texture is lively and crisp.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5259,5260,88,Ca' del Bosco NV Cuvée Prestige Sparkling (Franciacorta),"This golden-hued sparkler opens with aromas of yellow orchard fruit, citrus and a whiff of bread crust that carry over to the crisp palate along with a nutty note. A firm, persistent perlage offsets the ripe fruit flavors.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
5260,5261,88,Chassenay d'Arce 2005 Blanc de Blancs Millésimé Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"A soft style of Blanc de Blancs, rounded as much as crisp, this is an attractively ripe and fruity wine. Apple and grapefruit flavors are filled out with perfumed acidity and a lively, fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5261,5262,88,Château de Chatelard 2014 Cuvée Secret de  (Beaujolais Blanc),"This is a fragrant, ripe wine that while delicious to drink now really does need a few months aging. Fruity with apples, lime and green-plum flavors it also has a fine texture that gives structure and will allow the potential richness to develop. Drink from late 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5262,5263,88,DeMorgenzon 2014 DMZ Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"This is an easy, clean and direct Sauvy, with fresh notes of lime, tart gooseberry and green plum on the nose and mouth. The palate is lively and bright, finishing mouthwatering and refreshing. Drink now.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
5263,5264,88,Do Ferreiro 2013 Rebisaca Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Slightly oily, mature aromas of apple and peach break up quickly. This single-vineyard Albariño feels lean and narrow. Citrusy flavors of tangerine and grapefruit finish racy and zesty. Drink now.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5264,5265,88,Domaine du Clos du Fief 2014 Fleur de  (Beaujolais-Villages),"Grown in the far north of Beaujolais, almost in Burgundy's Mâcon region, this full and ripe Chardonnay is full of spice and toast as well as rich yellow fruits. It is still young, with intense citrus flavors, so wait to drink until 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5265,5266,88,Chehalem 2013 Three Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This blend of the three estate vineyards is the first Pinot to be released from each vintage. Here it spent time in 22% oak, roughly half new. Cranberry, pomengranate, dried herbs and some gently earthy tannins combine in a tart, gulpable style.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5266,5267,88,Henri Abelé NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"This wine, with its acidity, is so crisp and bright. Touches of red fruits give the wine a riper character, although what makes it most attractive is the freshness and the delicious fruity aftertaste. Drink this bottle as a fine apéritif.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

5268,5269,88,Lorenzi Estate 2011 Lot 451 Syrah (Temecula Valley),"Stewed olallieberries and black cherries gain nuance from concentrated red rose petals, cola and gravel on this wine from Riverside County. Like many of this winery's bottlings, the palate shows lots of barrel influence, with strong vanilla elements laced amidst blueberry and lighter red fruits.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
5269,5270,88,Dutton Estate 2013 Manzana Vineyard Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a full-bodied wine, soft and smooth with integrated tannins, yet robust in black cherry and graham cracker. The savory fruit is seasoned in baking spices and a touch of herbes de Provence, finishing with aplomb.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
5270,5271,88,Espaço Rural 2013 Dornas Branco White (Alentejano),This is a delicious wine full of ripe fruit tones. It is richly textured while keeping plenty of freshness from the Antão Vaz that dominates the blend. It has a firm mineral background that gives structure. The finish brings a zippy orange zest note.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
5271,5272,90,Domaine de la Sauveuse 2006 Cuvée Philippine Red (Côtes de Provence),"Like the estate's Cuvée Carolle, this has a note of volatility and sur-maturité, but it's also bigger, richer and more extracted, with lots of ripe tannins but also thick purple fruit that comes through on the finish. Try in 2010. 40% Syrah, 40% Cab Sauvignon, 10% Mourvèdre, 10% Grenache.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
5272,5273,90,Gary Farrell 2005 Ramal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"The Ramal Vineyard has been source to a fine series of Buena Vista Pinot Noirs. Farrell has captured another interpretation of its terroir, not quite as lush or ripe, but firm in acid-inspired cherries and licorice, with a subtle veneer of smoky oak. It's a dry, crisp young wine, well-structured, a good partner for upscale fare such as lamb chops.",Anonymous,
5273,5274,90,Seven Hills 2005 Ciel du Cheval Red Red (Red Mountain),"A beautifully structured Bordeaux blend from one of Washington's great vineyards. This spent about 18 months in French oak, and another 9–10 months in bottle. It is sleek and somewhat austere at first, but sculpted and evocative, with subtle, mixed fruits and impressions of steel and gunpowder. As the fruit comes up it shows some pretty blackberry and black cherry character, nicely balanced and set to evolve over the next decade or more.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5274,5275,90,Soléna 2005 Willakia Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"The vineyard name is a combination of the two prevalent soil types, Nekia and WillaKenzie. The Dijon clone Pinot is dark and pleasantly earthy, with core flavors of cassis and cherry liqueur. The earthy, slightly rustic tannins coat the throat, leaving an astringent, green tea residue, but the silky fruit compensates. This needs some further bottle age to really shine.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5275,5276,90,Twisted Oak 2006 %@#$! White (Sierra Foothills),"The honeyed aroma of this Rhône blend of Marsanne, Roussanne, Rolle and Viognier makes it immediately attractive, but then the flavors kick in, and it turns into a roller coaster ride. Apricot jam, peaches, pears, pineapples, butter-sautéed plaintain, vanilla custard, star anise, lemon crème brûlée, the list goes on and on. The finish is fully dry and the alcohol is refreshingly low. Drink now.",Anonymous,
5276,5277,90,Marega 2003 Holbar Bianco White (Friuli),"Here's an intense, slightly oxidized, 80-20 blend of Riesling and Chard that is redolent of apple, pear, pine nut, resin and maple syrup. The wine has loads of personality and complexity and is very unique in a non-commercial way. The word Holbar refers to the acacia wood casks used to age the wine.",Anonymous,
5277,5278,90,Viña Pérez Cruz 2003 Cot Reserva Limited Edition Malbec (Maipo Valley),"It's not often that we come across Chilean Malbec (Cot) with several years of bottle age, but this offers that and a little more. The nose is pure, with herbal hints and plenty of sauvage character. Roundness and depth give it length on the palate, which is endowed with solid berry flavors and proper savory accents. A wine with personality that's drinking perfectly right now.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5278,5279,90,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2006 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Estate Vineyard bottling shows a definite meaty, almost Rhone-like aroma, but this is no Syrah. It's a very elegant, light, sultry bottle of Pinot Noir. The tart black cherry and currant fruit is shadowed by smoke and cinnamon, but the balance throughout is light and delicate.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5279,5280,89,Chatter Creek 2005 Clifton Hill Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Clifton Hill Syrah looks and smells the way you'd hope it would, black in the center, purple/garnet at the edges, peppery and loaded with sweet grapey fruit. Viognier skins—not juice—added to the fermenter elevate the aromas with floral and citrus accents. It's juicy and fairly light in flavor, but clean and very fresh, with no new oak.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5280,5281,89,Clos Saint-Joseph 2004 Villars-sur-Var Red (Côtes de Provence),"This is an unusually elegant wine for Provence, from a tiny, isolated vineyard in the maritime Alps. It's a blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre, that's gently extracted, crimson in color and filled with intricate, delicate fragrances and flavors, ranging from violets and a hint of iodine to red cherries and maybe even a touch of apricot. Drink now and over the next few years.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
5281,5282,89,Cortes de Cima 2005 Incógnito Red (Alentejano),"A wine that has become something of a cult in Portugal, perhaps because of its mystery name (referring to a time when Syrah was not permitted in Portugal). This 2005 keeps the open, ripe blackberry jam fruit, with dark chocolate and herbal flavors. It has a generous, earthy character.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5282,5283,89,Domaine Sorin 2007 Terra Amata Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"More complex and richly textured than most Provençal rosés, this wine is a treat, from its mineral-laden, smoky aromas to its ripe cherry-berry flavors and layered finish. Drink now, although it has enough stuffing to suggest it might last longer than just a single summer.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
5283,5284,89,Dona Maria 2004 Amantis Red (Alentejano),"This rare blend of Cabernet, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Touriga Nacional works surprisingly well, emphasizing tannic structure rather than fruit. The acidity of the Cab is what keeps it from being heavy, while the dense color and herbal flavors show its southern warmth and richness. Dried plums and fresh acidity to finish.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5284,5285,89,Elyse 2005 Naggiar Vineyard C'est si Bon Red (Sierra Foothills),"Napa-based Elyse is better known for their Cabernet Sauvignon, but they have reached into Nevada County, in the Sierra Foothills, for this lovely Rhône-style blend. It's soft in acidity and the tannins are melted, as you might expect from a warm-to-hot region. But the flavors are plush in jammy cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and crushed black pepper.",Anonymous,
5285,5286,89,Brandborg 2006 Ferris Wheel Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"As with the other Pinots from Brandborg, this estate bottling puts the spices front and center, and matches the intensity of the fruit and barrels appropriately. This is seductive and elegant with a feminine grace. The spicy plum and red currant flavors carry some tasty barrel notes of clove and cinnamon, and the wine has a bit more intensity than its stablemates.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5286,5287,89,Casa de Santar 2006 Reserva White (Dão),"Ripe, soft wine that has good dense fruit flavors as well as richness. There is some new wood, but the wine remains elusive, perhaps still young. On the palate, the wood spice is still dominant, with only the acidity hinting at the fruit.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5287,5288,89,Pali 2006 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is interesting—a California take on Oregon Pinot Noir. It's sleek and spicy, with a racy spine and a very tart, dry mouthfeel. The fruit is peppery and hard; like hard candy with an herbal streak. The wine hides its almost 15% alcohol quite well, but it will reward ample breathing time.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5288,5289,88,Raphael Dal Bo NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),White spring flower and white peach aromas jump out of the glass and follow through to the vibrant palate along with crisp green apple. A soft mousse lends finesse.,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
5289,5290,88,Rideau 2014 Estate Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley),"Lightly mauve in color, this rosé blend of 51% Syrah, 21% Grenache and 28% Mourvèdre shows ripe watermelon, bubblegum and strawberry on the juicy nose. The palate is quite restrained for such a ripe nose and deep color, but ripe plums emerge alongside graphite minerality and a pithy grip.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
5290,5291,88,Santa Ema 2013 Amplus Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Plum and raspberry aromas are herbal and slightly grassy. On the tongue, wiry acidity feels citric. Flavors of red plum, spiced cherry, tomato and herbs ride a road of choppy acidity and rough tannins to a bold finish. Drink through 2020.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5291,5292,88,Santa Ema 2013 Amplus Old Vine Carignan (Maule Valley),"This dark, muscular Carignan smells cool and earthy, with a heavy dose of unintegrated oak creating woodgrain and vanilla aromas. This feels full but shows structural gaps, while blackberry, clove and resiny, grainy flavors finish with tannic hardness and lasting woody flavors.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5292,5293,88,Sierra Starr 2012 Inertia Red (Sierra Foothills),Dark fruit aromas and flavors join with a generous texture and full body to make a complete and satisfying wine. This has just enough tannin to make it appetizing and well balanced.,Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
5293,5294,88,Tolosa 2013 Clonal Select Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"This blended study of 2A, 115, 667 and Pommard clones shows black pepper, red cherry, pressed purple flowers, eucalyptus and a touch of hot asphalt on the nose. The lean and light palate conveys lots of dried herbs and raspberry-cranberry juice, enlivening the tongue with sourness.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
5294,5295,88,Vignerons de Bel Air 2014 Grande QV  (Coteaux Bourguignons),"Made from selected parcels of Gamay, this structured wine offers both fruit and fresh acidity.

5297,5298,88,Ventosa NV Saggio Series X Red (Seneca Lake),"Four years in a mix of French, American and Hungarian oak lend a prominent spice and tobacco savoriness to this full-bodied red. A blend of traditional Bordeaux grapes with a splash of Syrah, it's densely berried and luscious in texture, but maintains elegant composure. The finish is long, marked by penetrating,fine-grained tannins.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
5298,5299,88,Vino z Czech 2009 Ludwig Cabernet Moravia (Moravia),"Made with 100% Cabernet Moravia (an indigenous crossing of Cabernet Franc and Zweigelt) this wine has an interesting bouquet of ripe red fruits marked by eucalyptus and a heavy vegetal note.

5299,5300,88,Vino z Czech 2013 Znovín Znojmo St. Laurent (Moravia),"On the nose, spice outweighs fruit, with notes of clove and cinnamon backed by a touch of cherry.

5300,5301,88,Weather 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earthy mushroom and forest floor rise from the opening bouquet of this reserve-level wine that expresses itself in dense, full-bodied layers of dark, bittersweet cherry.

5301,5302,88,Willm 2014 Réserve Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Notes of candied mandarins steal their way into this fresh, fruity and blossom-scented wine—think apricot, tangerine and jasmine.

5303,5304,88,Sobon Estate 2012 Rocky Top Zinfandel (Amador County),"Let's call it a highly stylized but nonetheless attractive wine.

5311,5312,94,Tapiz 2012 Las Notas de Jean Claude Merlot (Mendoza),"One of Argentina's few high-end Merlots, this opens with maple, toasty oak and deep berry aromas. With 9% Petit Verdot and Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc mixed in, this feels juicy, ripped and eminently healthy. Flavors of coffee, blackberry and cherry are deep and pure, while this avoids being overweight by tipping the scales at 13.9% abv. Drink through 2022.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5312,5313,94,Dr. Loosen 2014 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"A crush of mineral notes on the nose lend earthy dimension to this buoyantly ripe, fruity auslese.

5314,5315,94,Robert Oatley 2011 The Pennant Hand Selected Limited Release Chardonnay (Margaret River),"Nearing maturity, this is a full-bodied, rich Chardonnay despite weighing in at only 12.5% abv. Scents of custard-meringue pie become more pungent and savory with air, adding hints of roasted mushrooms, smoke and maybe even some bacon fat.

5315,5316,94,Scar of the Sea 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Block Q Old Vine Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"There's a very appealing sense of hickory smoke to this wine, which comes from a block planted in 1973 on this historic vineyard.

5316,5317,94,Naggiar 2014 Estate Petite Sirah (Sierra Foothills),"Naggiar makes at least 15 wines from its estate vineyard, and really hit a home run with this classic that should have a long life ahead of it. The color is dark and intense right to the rim, while aromas blend a subtle spiciness with bold and complex fruit notes. Flavors convey concentrated dark chocolate, black cherry and espresso. It's enjoyable now with big proteins, but will be best after 2020.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
5317,5318,94,Karl Schaefer 2014 Unsteiner Herrenberg GG Dry Riesling (Pfalz),"A pleasantly savory touch of earth and nut on the nose lends complexity to this lusciously citrusy dry wine. Fresh white grapefruit, lemon and lime flavors are penetrating on the palate, glazed by a luminous sheen of crushed minerals and cutting acidity.

5318,5319,94,Franz Keller 2014 Franz Anton Schwarzer Adler Pinot Noir (Baden),"Robust in body yet squarely structured, the Franz Anton shows more ripeness and concentration than the producer's standard-label bottling. Fleshy black cherry and berry flavors are ripe, but are offset by crisp acidity and a shroud of smoke and toast that accents without overwhelming. It's bold and penetrating, with a long finish marked by fine, persistent tannins. Delicious already, but bold enough to improve through at least 2030.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,

At this stage, it is dominated by firm tannins as much as by the perfumed juicy black fruits.

5326,5327,94,Davies 2013 Winfield Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"Winfield is up-valley in Calistoga, on the lower slopes of Mount St. Helena, where volcanic soils rule. Rich and grippy, this beautiful wine is savory and elegantly bold, a mix of black pepper, leather saddle and blackberry compote, its concentration complemented by streaks of acidity and lurking freshness. It should do well in the cellar for the patient who can painfully wait.",Virginie Boone,@vboone

Apricot and yellow peach flavors penetrate deeply, catapulted by shards of lemon-lime acidity.

The nose is slightly sweet smelling and the mouthfeel is modern, penetrating, plush and velvety.",Anonymous,
5437,5438,91,Pol Roger NV Pure Brut Nature  (Champagne),"Pol Roger's excursion into a bone-dry Champagne brings a house style with natural weight up against an almost bony wine style. The resulting mix is certainly dry, edgy, very crisp, leaning towards austere. Extra bottle time would help the wine to gain weight and flesh out the structure.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5438,5439,91,Soutiran NV Brut Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Champagne),"The wine is rich, complex, softly creamy, but at the same time dry. It has a wine-like weight, a full mouthfeel of puréed apples and white currants, finishing though with mineral acidity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5439,5440,91,Suacci Carciere Wines 2007 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Comes down on the opposite side of the spectrum from the opulent 2006, a bone-dry, acidic young Chardonnay marked more by minerals than fruit.

5440,5441,91,Bedarra 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley),"Strikes an interesting balance between richness and austerity. Will fascinate true connoisseurs for its mineral-laden suggestions of dried lemons and kaffir limes, and the way sweet oak elaborates them.

5447,5448,90,Cambria 2014 Clone 4 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This latest bottling from the Jackson Family Wines' “Seeds of Empowerment” fundraising series shows woody, somewhat gamy aromas of animal hide alongside black cherry and sandalwood spice.

Stylistically somewhat unique for Washington, it brings brooding aromas of sauvage, herb, smoked meat and white pepper, along with a bit of reduction. The fruit flavors are pure and bring an appealing sense of texture. Give it time to open up and pair it with food to see it at its best.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
5452,5453,90,Diora 2014 Three Crowns Red (San Bernabe),"This is a hearty and hedonistic blend of Syrah, Grenache, Viognier and Petit Verdot from one of Monterey's warmer regions. Pure blackberries and black cherries show on the brooding nose, with touches of mint and licorice. The palate is soft on entry, then come boisterous flavors of black currant and blueberry. Nettle, fennel and coffee elements add depth.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
5453,5454,90,Domaine de Mourchon 2014 Tradition Red,"From a somewhat maligned vintage, this is a commendable effort. It's not as textural as the wine can be in better years, but it shows enough richness to easily carry the attractive leather, mocha and spice flavors. Drink now–2025.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
5454,5455,90,Prieler 2016 Sinner Chardonnay (Burgenland),"The grounded, earthy roundness of oak is immediately apparent on the nose, adding floral notes of hay and fresh field mushroom.

It finishes clean and bright.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
5455,5456,90,Rasa 2014 Plus One Kiona Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Although it's 100% varietal and comes from one of the state's oldest Cabernet vineyards, this wine is somewhat blue-fruited for the variety, with notes of plum and mountain blueberry along with herb, graphite, espresso and spice. The palate shows more of the same, bringing a sense of restraint and polish along with lightly grainy tannins that need some time to stretch their legs. It doesn't scream Cabernet but it still brings plenty of appeal. Best after 2022.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
5456,5457,90,Rattalino 2013 Trentaquattro  (Barolo),"You'll find aromas suggesting mature dark-skinned berry, violet, tobacco and an earthy whiff of game on this.

5457,5458,90,Roger Roessler 2015 Lennox Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Moderate in structure, full bodied and ripe, this wine is tightly wound in firm, strong tannin. Light flavors of cherry and orange integrate spiky accents of clove, tea and dried herb.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
5458,5459,90,Stevens 2014 StevensXY Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"The aromas are bright, with notes of savory herb, orange peel, cranberry and spice. The flavors are higher in acidity, tart and puckering, with orange-peel flavors lingering on the finish. The tannins seem a little crunchy right now but should soften with some additional time in the bottle. It's a stylistically unique wine for the state. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
5459,5460,90,Casa Dumetz 2014 Flower & VIne Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"From the vineyard once known as Alisos comes this wine, with aromas of soft clove, red cherry and a touch of sage. A strong ginger spice reigns over the palate, which is bitingly acidic, and shows dark strawberry fruit and dark thyme herbs. This wine is still quite wound up, but that acidity will prove mouthwatering for years to come.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
5460,5461,90,Château de Lavernette NV Brut Nature  (Crémant de Bourgogne),"Aged for a year on its lees, this wine is rich, tangy and refreshingly crisp.

5462,5463,90,Fritz Müller NV Perlwein Trocken Müller-Thurgau (Rheinhessen),"Delightfully fun and refreshing, this perlwein, or lightly sparkling white, is Germany's answer to Italian prosecco. Made from Müller-Thurgau grapes, it's gorgeously floral, but with a chalky, earthen tang. Sprightly acidity and a fresh, green touch lends vibrance to a moderately long finish.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
5463,5464,90,Casa del Valle 2011 Orquestal Tempranillo (La Mancha),"Aromas of mulled black fruits, vanilla, tobacco, orange peel and earth are a touch jumbled, but compartmentalized—this smells nice. Wiry and fresh in feel, but with a slightly hollow midsection, this tastes peppery, oaky and like cherry and black plum. A toasty finish with snappy acidity solidifies this medium-weight La Mancha Tempranillo. Drink through 2019.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5464,5465,90,Chateau Margene 2013 Signature Series Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),"Winemaker Mike Mooney adds complexity with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot on this bottling, which shows blueberries, crushed black rocks and dark chocolate on the nose, but doesn't offer a lot of Cab Francness. The palate does offer some, however, with grippy tannins and dried oregano touches laid across rich black cherry, blueberry, fudge and espresso notes.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
5465,5466,90,Domaine Faiveley 2014 Clos du Roy Premier Cru  (Mercurey),"With some firm structure behind the red fruits, this wine will have a good future.

5466,5467,90,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann 2014 L'Aplomb White (Alsace),"Subtle hints of ripe, winter-stored apple on the nose lead to an equally apple-dominated palate that shows soft pepper spice. A wonderful midpalate texture and baked-apple richness are countered by lemon freshness. This is very appetizing and cries out for soft cheeses.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
5467,5468,90,Domaine Terre de Mistral 2015 Pauline Rosé (Mediterranée),"On the basis that anything goes with rosé, this wine is 100-percent Sangiovese, known locally as Niellucciu. The acidity that is typical of the grape is very present as are red cherry and tight fruit flavors. It is so crisp and lively, bouncing from the glass and leaving a beautiful array of red fruits at the end.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5468,5469,90,Remelluri 2011 Lindes de San Vincente  (Rioja),"This is a ripe, earthy, modern-leaning Rioja with aromas of blackberry, raisin and rubber. Soft and fleshy on the palate, what this easygoing number lacks in structure is made up for in charm. Ultraripe flavors of plum and berry come with a chocolaty accent, while the finish is smooth and tastes earthy and spicy. Drink through 2019.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5469,5470,90,Rioja Vega 2012 Crianza  (Rioja),"Widely available Rioja Crianzas don't come much better than this. An opening of raspberry and strawberry aromas backed by direct cherry, raspberry and red-plum flavors render this all about fruit and freshness.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

5471,5472,90,Beaucanon 2011 Cuvée Louis Merlot (Napa Valley),"A healthy addition of 12% Petit Verdot plays well in this wine. This is exuberant in black plum, chocolate and black pepper, with full-bodied and present oak, yet it also has a soft, approachability to the palate.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
5472,5473,90,Beaucanon 2013 Longwood Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"While Cabernet Sauvignon dominant, all five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here. Dark in color, a combination of black pepper and black-fruit syrup meets earthy and dry tannins. This structured wine needs time. Cellar through 2020.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
5473,5474,90,Benessere 2013 Collins Holystone Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (St. Helena),"From vines more than 90-years-old, this is a refreshingly restrained and elegant wine, earthy in grilled mushroom and cherry-berry juiciness, braced in firm acidity.

5474,5475,90,Biondi 2014 Chianta Bianco  (Etna),"Scents of Spanish broom, pineapple, orchard fruit and a saline note meld together in the glass. The focused palate offers mature apple, peach, botanical herb and mineral alongside firm acidity.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
5475,5476,90,Bodegas Muriel 2011 Fincas de la Villa Reserva  (Rioja),"Baked, rooty aromas of sandalwood, exotic spices and berry fruits are attractive.

5481,5482,90,King Estate 2014 Paradox Pinot Gris (Oregon),"The King Estate name is intentionally printed upside down on the label, emphasizing the paradoxical nature of the wine, which has been barrel aged. As when oak is applied to Pinot Gris, it mutes the varietal nuances of the grape. So along with tart apple and pear fruit, you'll find a softer palate, with vanilla and buttered nuts in the aftertaste.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5482,5483,91,Ottimino Vineyards 2013 Zinfinity Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"From a selection of its best vineyards across the county, this producer showcases a majority of the variety with 16% Petite Sirah, all aged in French oak, 25% of it new.

5483,5484,91,Palencia 2013 El Viñador Petit Verdot (Wahluke Slope),Brooding aromas of moist soil and dark cherry are followed by big bold cherry flavors that coat the palate. The variety's often burly tannins are kept well in check.,Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport

5487,5488,91,Cloudy Bay 2013 Te Koko Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The most recent release of Te Koko seems tamer, more controlled than some previous vintages.

It embodies elegance and precision in place of wildness and raw power.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
5488,5489,91,Foxtrot 2012 Henricsson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley),"The complex aromatics, texture and detail on display here may dazzle you.

5494,5495,91,Naggiar 2014 Dahlia Noir Red (Sierra Foothills),"A very dark color, tons of ripe fruit aromas and abundant black-fruit flavors give a lot of wallop to this full-bodied but not overly sweet or fat Rhône-style blend. Ripe blackberry, stewed plum and a touch of smoke hang on a big structure of firm tannins and good acidity. It will be best after 2019, but it's difficult not to drink up at this price.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
5495,5496,91,Netzl 2015 Bärnreiser Weissburgunder (Carnuntum),The nose is a very inviting and attractive mix of bright blossom honey and ripe lemon peel: the palate follows with rounded richness that is streamlined by lovely unobtrusive freshness.

5500,5501,91,Rainer Wess 2015 Pfaffenberg Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),"Ripe, almost candied notions of stone fruit appear. They are so concentrated they have an almost fruit-jelly intensity. There also is a note of earth that flows from the nose onto the generous fleshy palate. The finish is clean on this wine, which holds all the fruit of a ripe and generous year.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
5501,5502,91,Jaxon Keys 2013 Estate Allie Key's Vineyard Petite Sirah (Mendocino),"Mouthfilling, mouthcoating and full bodied, this dark-colored wine blends ripe but not sweet blackberry and black-cherry flavors with dark chocolate and baking-spice nuances for a complex and delicious taste profile. It's rich enough in flavor and viscous enough in texture that the abundant tannins seem to be absorbed, and the mouthfeel is soothing. Best from 2018–2023.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
5502,5503,91,Marietta Cellars NV Christo Lot Number 3 Red (North Coast),"Dark, dense, rich and spicy, this Rhône-style blend is impressively delicious. Full bodied, it's saturated with blackberry, cinnamon and black-pepper flavors supported by fine-grained tannins. While it packs a punch, it is well balanced for a big, assertive wine, and will be best after 2019.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
5503,5504,86,La Vis 2005 Dipinti Sauvignon (Trentino),"La Vis's Dipinti series has preformed well thanks to attractive pricing. This expression of Sauvignon offers evident herbal characteristics, as well as mineral ones. Think chopped sage and basil and drying white stone.",Anonymous,

5505,5506,86,The Crossings 2006 Unoaked Chardonnay (Marlborough),"Like most unoaked Chardonnays, this is a bit simply fruity, but it's also clean and fresh. Apple, melon and citrus flavors are easily carried by its medium body and mouthwatering finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
5506,5507,86,Enrique Foster 2006 IQUE Malbec (Mendoza),"A draft of menthol and aromas of chocolate and mossy fruit work pretty nicely on the nose, while the palate is superripe, a bit candied and accented by spice and coffee. This is a strong starter, though it falls off a little on the finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5507,5508,86,Hugh Hamilton 2005 Jim Jim Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"A good wine at a good price, the 2006 Jim-Jim Shiraz offers bouncy raspberry fruit, hints of cracked pepper and vanilla and a medium-bodied, reasonably lush mouthfeel. Multiple U.S. importers.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
5508,5509,86,Bodegas Escorihuela 2006 Cruz Alta Reserve Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Pineapple and apple aromas are fairly attractive and fresh, as is the light, wet and zippy palate, which shows mostly citrus and apple flavors.

5509,5510,86,Columbia Crest 2005 Grand Estates Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Big, bold, and buttery, with plenty of oaky micro-popcorn flavors. Don't look for subtlety, but you get plenty of flavor.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5510,5511,86,Sagelands 2004 Four Corners Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Price rise. With broad flavors of berry and chocolate, this is pleasant and undistinguished. This does not have the weight or varietal presence of the winery's Merlot.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5511,5512,86,Trapiche 2005 Oak Cask Syrah (Mendoza),"Big and boisterous, as if you're sniffing a bed of coal, menthol and macerated black fruit. The palate is sun-drenched and juicy, but not what you'd call elevated. And the finish mixes savory flavors with tight tannins. A good red wine that bears little semblance to Old World Syrah.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5512,5513,86,Masottina 2005 Vigneto ai Palazzi Chardonnay (Piave),"This is a simple, friendly wine with a pretty dusty, mineral quality that frames fresher aromas of pear, peach and golden apple. It's a bit toned down in terms of flavors intensity but does end on a playful spicy note.",Anonymous,
5513,5514,86,Zaca Mesa 2004 Z Three Red Wine Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"A southern Rhône blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this wine is stylish and elegant, with a smooth, silky texture. But it's just a little too sugary sweet to earn a higher score, with the blackberry and cherry fruit having a jellied, candied edge.",Anonymous,
5514,5515,86,Heidsieck & Co Monopole NV Rosé Top  (Champagne),"A lively Champagne, initially all froth and fizz. But get through that and there is a pleasant, slightly sweet wine— perhaps more full-bodied than some.

5516,5517,95,Dutton-Goldfield 2009 Dutton Ranch - Freestone Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Mouthwatering acidity and berry freshness mark this muscular young Pinot Noir. It's gritty in tannins and brilliant in acids, with subtle flavors of sour red cherries, persimmons and cola, as well as a mushroomy earthiness to which oak adds exotic sandalwood notes.

5518,5519,94,Dutton-Goldfield 2009 McDougall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Somewhere between the acidity and dryness, this Pinot has a terrifically interesting core. It's a subtle wine, now suggesting cherry fruit, now retreating in favor of earthier mushrooms, minerals and pine needles, framed in firm tannins. Strikes out new territory for cool-climate Pinot Noir, less ripe, lower in alcohol and more exciting.",Anonymous,
5519,5520,94,Talley 2009 Rosemary's Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),"A brilliant Chardonnay, bone dry and crisp in acidity.

Feels weighty and important, and finishes wonderfully dry.",Anonymous,
5520,5521,94,Babcock 2009 Upper Crust Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"The real deal in a cool-climate Syrah. Dark and broodingly dry, it smells like grilled lamb, roasted rosemary, white pepper and other Provençal herbs, blackberries, cassis and smoky oak. High in alcohol but balanced, this 100% varietal wine is huge, powerful, dramatic and tannic. Drink it soon with the best grilled meats.",Anonymous,
5521,5522,94,I Giusti e Zanza 2007 Dulcamara Red (Toscana),"This gorgeous blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot offers beautiful intensity and impressive complexity.

5522,5523,94,Fort Ross 2007 Fort Ross Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A very beautiful wine that shows the exotic, feral quality of the greatest Pinot Noirs from the Fort Ross area.

5524,5525,94,Keenan 2007 Reserve Mailbox Vineyard Merlot (Spring Mountain District),"Just delicious, an important, elegant Merlot to drink with the finest steaks and chops.

5527,5528,94,Sheldon 2009 Ripken Vineyard Graciano (Lodi),"This might be one of the most interesting wines being made in California right now, a tiny production, 12%-alcohol Graciano, a grape native to Rioja and barely found in California. The wine is bright and very European, full of white pepper, cranberry and leather notes, high in acid and very clean, though it's unfined and unfiltered. It lasts and lasts, getting better with every drop.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
5528,5529,94,Clendenen 2003 Brico Buon Natale Nebbiolo (Santa Maria Valley),"One of the best Nebbiolos to ever come from California. The aroma dazzles with notes of tar, licorice, roasted meat, cherries, pepper and cedar. The wine is absolutely dry, with brilliant acidity, and seems to change with each moment in the glass.

5530,5531,94,Hall 2008 Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a best of barrels blend from Hall's various vineyards, including the famous Sacrashe. The wine itself is lovely. It has a firm structure thanks to dusty tannins and a dry minerality, while bright acidity makes the cherry, blackberry, blueberry, cassis and dark chocolate fruit sing. Drink now and through 2014.",Anonymous,
5531,5532,93,E. Guigal 2008 La Doriane  (Condrieu),"Guigal's luxury cuvée from Condrieu is a great success in 2008, marrying richness and power with hints of honeysuckle, toasted nuts and apricot.

5532,5533,93,Arista 2009 Woodruff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"The oak sticks out now in the form of toast and sweet wood sap, but that's because it hasn't been integrated into this fine young wine. Give it 3–4 years to come around, by which time the barrel influence will equalize with the ripe raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola and red currants. Could be quite special around 2015.",Anonymous,

5543,5544,81,Duca del Frassino 2010 Pinot Noir-Merlot Red (Venezia),"A boxed wine, this blend of Pinot Noir and Merlot is exceedingly simple and one-dimensional but could be served at an outdoor baseball game. The mouthfeel is watery and thin.",Anonymous,

5547,5548,81,Opolo 2011 Mountain Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Soft, and rich with glycerine and alcohol, this Zin is almost a Port wine on the palate. Drunk on its own, it's simple and awkward, but paté is kind to it.",Anonymous,

5552,5553,96,Figgins 2010 Estate Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is the third release of Figgins, a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins from his Figgins Estate vineyard. Intensely aromatic, it explodes from the glass with baking spices and deep cassis fruit. Over the course of three days it opened into a sleek, stylish, complex mix of purple- and black-berries, dried herbs, bark, dusty cocoa and a streak of caramel. Long and lush, it's a wine to cellar for a decade or more.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5553,5554,96,Williams Selyem 2011 Terra de Promissio Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A new bottling from the winery. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, a cool area south of the Russian River Valley, toward San Francisco. The vintage was cool, too, so the wine is brisk in acidity and low in alcohol, but it still tastes amazingly ripe and complex. The wine dazzles with waves of black raspberry jam, sweet olive tapenade, sautéed brown mushroom, root beer, moo-shu plum sauce and mocha. If those flavors sound like they don't go together, just try the wine. It's seamless and compelling. Drink now–2020.",Anonymous,
5554,5555,95,Von Strasser 2010 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District),"This is a 40-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, with the balance consisting of Merlot. It's a barrel selection of the winery's best lots, from its various vineyards, and has been aged in 100% new French oak. Yet it's not oaky at all, with the wood bringing only additional sweet, smoky richness to the red currants, cherries, dark chocolate and spices. This is a superb wine, delicious right out of the bottle, but it should develop and, depending on your tastes, improve over the next 20 years.",Anonymous,
5555,5556,95,Gorman 2009 The Bully Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"The 2009 Bully includes 10% Petit Verdot.

This is a big bruiser, but beautifully proportioned.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5556,5557,95,Failla 2011 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Lucky Failla gets to source grapes from this vineyard that most winemakers would trade their left arm for. It's lush, ripe and amazingly generous in raspberries and cherries, yet retains an elegant balance, as well as fine, mouthwatering acidity. Part of the attraction is low alcohol, which lets the stones and earthy complexities of the wine shine through. This is really a brilliant wine—light, delicate and powerful. If you want to age it for eight years or so, you won't be sorry.",Anonymous,
5557,5558,90,Philip Shaw 2006 No. 11 Chardonnay (Orange),"A bit unyielding on the nose, then the palate shows rather tight and citrusy flavors.

This seemingly contradictory wine just needs some time to develop; try after 2009.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
5558,5559,90,Rosenhof 2004 Trockenbeerenauslese Chardonnay (Burgenland),"There's no question about the huge richness of this wine—it is there from the initial aroma.

5559,5560,90,Siduri 2007 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Here's a big, thick, rich, jammy young Pinot Noir.

Will probably age for many years.",Anonymous,
5560,5561,90,Sparkman 2007 Lumière Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is minimal intervention winemaking, using native yeast, then put through 100% malolactic and given weekly batinage (lees stirring) in 50% new barrels.

5561,5562,90,Fort Ross 2005 Fort Ross Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Quite rich and full-bodied, this dry young Pinot is loaded with oodles of red currants, cherries, mocha and cola.

5562,5563,90,Château Margaux 2006 Pavillon Rouge de Château Margaux  (Margaux),"Delicate and elegant wine, with smoky fruit, ripe but freshened with a tight layer of acidity. It has delicious black currant juice flavors, but the texture remains light and the tannins soft.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5563,5564,90,Château Montrose 2006 La Dame de Montrose  (Saint-Estèphe),"The second wine of Château Montrose is at a high level. With its ripe chocolate and sweet black currant flavors, the structure comes from dark tannins, which, as so often in Saint-Estèphe, are dry, but not hard, and have delicious fresh berry fruits to envelope them. A wine that is great for aging over 4–5 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

5567,5568,90,Girolamo Russo 2006 San Lorenzo  (Etna),"Light and tonic in appearance, this Etna-based wine is a profound expression of elegance.

5570,5571,90,Hedges 2006 Three Vineyards Red Red (Red Mountain),"Concentrated and slightly earthy, this has more density and grip (as it should) than the C.M.S. red, but a similar profile (51% Merlot, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc and 4% Syrah.) Black cherry and plum fruits are wrapped in light smoke and mocha flavors.

5571,5572,90,Domaine Serres Mazard 2004 Élevé en Fûts de Chêne Red (Corbières),"A terrific example of Corbières terroir at an unbeatable price. The wine, a traditional Rhône-style blend of Syrah, Grenache and Carignan, is so loaded with aromas and flavors of the surrounding garrigue you might think that they threw in a bouquet garni during maturation. Sage, rosemary,menthol, thyme and bay leaves all abound while rich, dark fruit and oak aging (Élevé en Fûts de Chêne means aged in oak barrels) provides support and structure. Silky texture, approachable tannins and a long finish bring it all together.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
5572,5573,90,Doyenne 2006 Métier Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Fruit compote—plum and strawberry—is melded to light toast and coffee. The wine has juicy acids and a thickly satisfying midpalate whose fruit flavors linger on, adding a little peppery spice as the wine evolves in the mouth. Just a whisp of chocolate leaves you ready for the next sip.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5573,5574,90,Dr. Wagner 2006 Saarburger Rausch Auslese Goldkap Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),"For being a goldkap, this is not especially lush or botrytized.

This is crisply balanced and mouthwatering on the finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
5574,5575,90,Quivira 2006 Wine Creek Ranch Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"A beautiful Syrah perfect for drinking now.

5579,5580,88,Les Frères Perroud 2013 Améthyste  (Brouilly),"With a year's age, this wine has softened its intense fruitiness and ripened with a rich, soft texture and well-integrated acidity.

5670,5671,90,Quinta da Romaneira 2013 R de Romaneira Red (Duriense),"The Syrah in this blend gives an extra perfume and spice to this rich wine. Its tannins and firm structure are balanced by the black fruits, acidity and Douro minerality. This wine is ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5671,5672,90,Casal da Coelheira 2016 Reserva Branco White (Tejo),"This is a successful blend of Chardonnay and Arinto that blends a creamy texture with crisp fruit flavors.

5672,5673,90,David Hill 2016 Estate Gewürztraminer (Willamette Valley),"Produced from vines a half century old, this is fermented completely dry yet retains a distinct floral/talc character. Although Alsatian in style it, exudes a bit of extra fruit flesh, as one would expect of Oregon. It's a lovely wine, with rose petal scents and light peach flavors.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5673,5674,90,Domaine Laporte 2015 La Comtesse  (Sancerre),"Hugely rich and in a seriously heavy bottle, this is a statement wine.

5675,5676,90,Ghost Hill 2015 Spirit of Pinot Noir Rosé,"The word scrumptious applies here. This rich and complex rosé from Eric Hamacher is a mix of saignée juice and Pinot Noir blanc that wasn't quite blanc enough—a happy accident, since it's packed with raspberry confit and plum jam flavors, with a hint of cranberry sauce. Coming up on two years past fermentation, it's a wine to drink now.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5676,5677,90,Herdade do Rocim 2013 Grande Rocim Reserva Alicante Bouschet (Alentejo),"Vineyard redevelopment and a new winery contributed to this fine expression of ripe Alicante Bouschet wine under the direction of Catarina Vieira.

5685,5686,86,Raphael 2010 La Tavola Red (North Fork of Long Island),"Hints of earth and mushroom, soy sauce and brine add umami to succulent blackberry and cherry flavors in this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend.

5690,5691,86,Merry Cellars 2011 Seven Hills Vineyard Carmenère (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Pure Carmenère can seem heavily tilted toward the green, stemmy side of the Bordeaux equation, as it is here. Cranberry fruit, tight and tart, hits a wall of tannins, not entirely ripe. The barrel flavors need more time to settle in.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5691,5692,86,Paso a Paso 2012 Made with Organic Grapes White (La Mancha),"Apple and stone-fruit aromas are basic, mild and good. This is creamy in the mouth, with green-apple acidity providing edge and cut. Flavors of apple, green herbs and nectarine finish smooth.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5692,5693,86,Phipps 2010 Heller Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma County),"This Merlot tastes hotter than than its official alcohol. A jalapeño pepper heat seems to accentuate the ripeness, so that raisins and prunes star. It's a robust, somewhat rustic wine of limited ageability, but it will pair well with strongly flavored, spicy beef stews and barbecue.",Anonymous,
5693,5694,86,Ca' Momi 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"The wine offers a fantastic array of butterscotch, orange, pineapple, peach and vanilla bean flavors, brightened with vital acidity. But as rich as the wine tastes, it lacks a certain distinction.",Anonymous,

5698,5699,88,Bergevin Lane 2008 Oui Deux Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"In sharp contrast to the heavily oaked companion Syrahs from Bergevin Lane, the Oui Deux puts the fruit up front. Spicy and sharp-toned, it was co-fermented with 5% Viognier, and for all practical terms is a Stonetree Vineyard bottling. It should continue to improve nicely with a couple more years of bottle age.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

5702,5703,88,J. & F. Lurton 2009 Hacienda Araucano Clos de Lolol Red (Lolol Valley),"Slightly clipped and hard on the bouquet, which is narrow and settles on berry fruit.

Becomes more stylish with airing, but it's always fairly hard and compact in character.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5703,5704,88,J. Rickards 2008 Ancestor Selections Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"They can't call the grapes old vine, because the vineyard is only 15 years old. But it was planted from clones that constituted an old vineyard that contained Petite Sirah, Carignane, Mataro and Alicante Bouschet. The wine is robust and rustic, with bright, briary berry fruit and spice flavors that will stand up well against any roasted meats.",Anonymous,
5704,5705,88,Kokomo 2009 Gopher Hill Block Peters Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A difficult wine to assess. It's so ripe and forward in sweet cherry jam and smoky, caramelized oak that it seems like a mere fruit bomb at first sip. But something about the structure goes well beyond simplicity. Could develop bottle complexity over the years, but it's unpredictable.",Anonymous,
5705,5706,88,Mercer 2008 McKinley Springs Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"Quite oaky, the barrel flavors not yet integrated into the fruit, this starts out rough, then rolls into clean, light, pleasant boysenberry fruit flavors.

5707,5708,88,Oveja Negra 2011 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc-Carmenère White (Maule Valley),"Mild and appealing on the nose, with just enough citrus to convince you that it's Sauvignon Blanc.

5713,5714,88,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2009 Le Dix de Los Vascos Red (Colchagua Valley),"Harmonious aromas of cassis, vanilla and mocha are inviting. The palate, however, seems narrow and high in acidity; it's grinding and choppy, with herbal, tangy flavors of berry and cassis mixed with tobacco and herbs.

5720,5721,94,Palmeri 2005 Van Ness Vineyard Syrah (Alexander Valley),"A noble red wine, based on the finely ground tannins and superb integration of fruit and oak.

5753,5754,89,Adams Bench 2010 Reckoning Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend of 48% Merlot, 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 10% Cab Franc looks a bit murky, unfiltered, and is currently showing a lot of influence from barrel aging. Medium-weight blackberry and cassis fruit is married to dark chocolate, with a dash of black olive in the mix. It's tasty for drinking 2017–2019.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5754,5755,89,Bret Brothers 2012 Climat La Martine  (Mâcon-Uchizy),"Wood flavors initially dominate this wine.

5758,5759,89,Fidelitas 2010 Champoux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"The oak (83% new French and American) seems a bit overweighted for the fruit that's in the bottle on this 100% varietal wine.

5759,5760,89,Foundry Vineyards 2011 Alla Prima Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though less expensive than the Artisan series releases from Foundry, the Alla Prima seems better balanced.

5762,5763,89,Ryan Patrick 2010 Rock Island Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Malbec and 8% Syrah.

Give the tannins a few more years to unfurl then drink to catch what remains of the fruit.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
5930,5931,87,Ponzi 2015 Pinot Noir Rosé (Willamette Valley),"Fresh and forward flavors mix rhubarb, ripe strawberries and sweet Bing cherries. This vibrant wine finishes with a refreshing snap of acidity, making it a pleasure to drink.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5931,5932,87,Producteurs Plaimont 2014 Moonseng Red (Côtes de Gascogne),The producer has the largest nursery of old grape varieties in southwest France and from it has plucked the Manseng Noir to blend with Merlot. The result is a rich wine with ripe Merlot red fruits that are given a more tannic character with the Manseng. There is a fresh juicy aftertaste that allows it to be drunk now.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
5932,5933,87,Quinta do Casal Monteiro 2014 Terra de Touros Red (Tejo),"This is a clever blend with the natural ripeness of Pinot Noir in Portugal smoothing out the firmer tannins of Touriga Nacional.

5933,5934,87,Quinta do Passadouro 2013 Passadouro Touriga Nacional (Douro),"The wine has plenty of fruit, the right layers of tannin. And yet it seems one-dimensional—something that can happen with Touriga Nacional. The depth and complexity found in previous vintages of this wine are missing. So you get bold black fruits and a stylish structure in a wine that is almost ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5934,5935,87,Quintas de Melgaço 2015 QM Terra Antiga White (Vinho Verde),This wine is all about fruit. It is dry and so fresh and crisp with apple and green pear flavors. There is a light prickle there that adds a dancing lightness to this refreshing wine.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
5935,5936,87,Ramón Bilbao 2011 Mirto  (Rioja),"Fiery and borderline herbaceous aromas are green-leaning, which is surprising considering that 2011 was a warm, dry, highly regarded vintage in Rioja. On the palate, this feels strained, with outsized acidity. Herbal, roasted wild-berry flavors come with a lot of oak and clove, while the finish is fairly tart and herbal.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5936,5937,87,JAQK Cellars 2013 High Roller Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Steely lemon and low oak star in this unfussy wine, which remains light bodied in spirit despite a rich finish of marshmallow and vanilla.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
5937,5938,87,Karl Schaefer 2014 Dry Grauburgunder (Pfalz),"Whiffs of brioche and biscuit mingle with pressed apple and pear in this sprightly dry Grauburgunder, or Pinot Gris. It's delicate in fruit concentration but its zesty, nimble style is refreshing. Drink now through 2018.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
5938,5939,87,Kason 2013 Old Vine Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Deep, dark and tannic, this pits black cherry and cassis fruit against thickly applied oak. They wrestle to a stand-off, just about equally matched. Pair this with grilled, well-seasoned salmon.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
5939,5940,87,La Braccesca 2014 Sabazio  (Rosso di Montepulciano),"Aromas of violet, wild red berry and dark cooking spice lift out of the glass. The aromas carry over to the soft, straightforward palate accompanied by mellow but rather fleeting tannins.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
5940,5941,87,Le Vigne 2013 Di Ranchita Vista Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),"Boysenberry, cracked rainbow peppercorns and dried rose petals show on the nose of this bottling, which plays to the lighter side of the grape. It's tart and brisk once sipped, with cranberry and pomegranate fruit given more complexity by a touch of wild fennel.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
5941,5942,87,Santa Luz 2013 Gran Corte Red (Colchagua Valley),"A heavy oak character controls the nose, and with it comes aromas of sawdust, vanilla, cocoa and raspberry. This feels a bit sticky and creamy, while palpable oak returns on the palate and creates vanilla, pepper and chocolate flavors. Heat, high acidity and peppery spice work the finish on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5942,5943,87,Silver Mountain 2014 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A perfect shade of medium pink, this is a standard, down-the-middle rose.

5943,5944,87,Snowden 2013 The Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Super-dark in color, this extracted wine offers a reductive note on the nose, followed by a rustic tinge of hay and brick. Intensely flavored and oaked, it finishes unexpectedly herbal and dry.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
5944,5945,87,Tres Palacios 2013 Family Vintage Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Aromas of tomato sauce and fresh green herbs set up true-to-Carmenère flavors of salty, herbal plum and berry. On the finish, typical varietal flavors of olive, herbs and spice are saucy.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5945,5946,87,Ventisquero 2013 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Chunky, herbal berry and plum aromas are the introduction. A tight, grabby, tannic palate delivers herbal plum and berry flavors backed by scratchy tannins. Overall, this is a good and fair rendition of Chilean Cabernet.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5946,5947,87,Vignamaggio 2014 Terre di Prenzano  (Chianti Classico),"Scents of fresh red berry, violet and cake spice meld together in the glass.

5947,5948,87,Vignerons de Bel Air 2014 Cuvées Classic  (Morgon),"This is a structured wine whose fruit is still coming through the tannins. It has a dry core, layers of acidity and juicy bitter cherry acidity. Drink from the end of 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5948,5949,87,Viluko 2014 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"This is a full-bodied, unctuous white with a wealth of wood influence. It tempers in the glass into a mix of melon, stone fruit and vanilla.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
5949,5950,87,Willowbrook 2013 Kaufman Sunnyslope Vineyard Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"Reduced on the nose, and showing strong barrel influence, this is a tangy, grippy, weighty wine. It's ripe and tightly wound, a sign of the vintage and most likely, vineyard site. Needing time to open in the glass, it unwinds slowly.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
5950,5951,87,Concha y Toro 2014 Casillero del Diablo Reserva Privada Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Piercing aromas of red-berry fruits and red-apple skins are a touch rough but improve with airing. This feels fresh, medium in size, and tastes of herbal plum and cherry prior to a lightly herbal finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5951,5952,87,Concha y Toro 2014 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Malbec (Central Valley),"Although this opens with aromatic notes of inner tube and iodine, airing reveals dry herb scents and medicinal cherry and berry aromas. With proper weight and balance, this basic Malbec tastes of cherry cough drop and plum, with a dash of green herbs.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5952,5953,87,Copper Belt 2012 Keating Reserve Red,"The winery went all out on this blend of 50% Syrah, 25% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, giving it three years in 20% new French oak.

5953,5954,93,Companhia das Quintas 2011 Quinta de Pancas Grande Escolha Red (Lisboa),"Big, black and juicy, it manages to be both dense and structured and freshly fruity at the same time. With this combination promising great things, the wine is ripe and fragrant. The dark color from the Petit Verdot in the blend follows through to the firm texture while allowing room for refreshing juiciness. Drink from 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5954,5955,93,Domdechant Werner 2012 Hochheimer Domdechaney Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau),"Green floral notes and juicy, ripe white peaches perfume this complex medium-sweet Riesling. It's ethereal on the palate but penetrating with stone fruit flavors and a sunny, bright tangerine acidity. Finishes with a lingering slick of wet-stone minerality.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
5955,5956,93,Errazuriz 2011 Don Maximiano Founder's Reserva Red (Aconcagua Valley),"Smooth, deep aromas of berry, spice, earth and minerals are rolled into a pure, harmonious whole. This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is racy, clean and layered on the tongue, while oaky flavors of vanilla and cream are backed by ribald blackberry and cassis. The elegant finish is potent and deep. Drink through 2020.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5956,5957,93,Errazuriz 2011 Viñedo Chadwick Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Confident, smoky aromas of black fruits, quality oak and minerality set up a round, dense, smooth palate that's as elegant as things get in Chile. True Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are spicy, lightly herbal and suggest licorice, cassis and blackberry. On the finish, warm oak, menthol and medicinal flavors call for another few years in bottle. Best from 2016–2023.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
5957,5958,93,Donkey & Goat 2011 The Recluse Broken Leg Vineyard Syrah (Anderson Valley),"There are subtle wild cherry and blackberry high notes in this stellar Syrah, much of it whole-cluster pressed from a cool site in a cool year. That combination of site and year dance into a peppery, leathery, savory, slightly smoky Syrah, medium in body, that's more about complexity and finesse than power.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
5958,5959,93,Gérard Bertrand 2011 Le Viala Red (Minervois La Liviniere),"This is a dense, flavorful and powerfully structured wine, brimming with notes of black cherry, plum, currant, baking spice, black pepper, crushed violet and bittersweet chocolate. It's full and chewy on the palate, with a firm structure and gripping tannins. Hints of licorice root, mocha and toasted sweet spice unfold on the finish.

5959,5960,93,Wines & Winemakers 2011 Companhia das Lezirias Tyto Alba Red (Tejo),"Almost black in color, this is a powerful and concentrated wine.

5961,5962,93,Clos de la Tech 2009 Domaine du Docteur Rodgers Pinot Noir (San Francisco Bay),"While impressive now for its weight and flavor profile, this should evolve well, thanks to its heavy tannins and ample concentration. Right now, there is wet earth and prominent mint on the nose. The palate also picks up spearmint, with sagebrush, licorice and tobacco as well. The tannins emerge at the end of the sip, and will continue to smooth out beyond 2020.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
5962,5963,93,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier 2012 Scharzhofberger Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Exotically floral and spicy, this delivers an intoxicating blend of exuberance and elegance.

5964,5965,93,Quinta de la Rosa 2011 La Rosa Reserva Red (Douro),"Powerful and tannic, this is a dense and complex wine. Made from selected barrels, it is structured as well as rich in fruit.

5965,5966,93,Quinta Dona Matilde 2008 Dona Matilde Reserva Tinto Red (Douro),"Complex, ripe and fruity, this is an impressive wine with an impressive future.

5966,5967,93,Sogrape 2011 Quinta dos Carvalhais Touriga Nacional (Dão),"Touriga Nacional is as much, maybe more, at home in the Dão as in the Douro. That's shown by this ripe and powerful wine that is still so young.

It needs several years aging, wait until 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
5967,5968,93,St. Rose 2011 Nunes Vineyard Ten Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light in color it's composed of violet and rose petal aromas, zippy in acidity, with layered dark cherry fruit and an earthy, herbal backbone.

5969,5970,93,Joseph Mellot 2012 La Grande Cuvée des Edvins  (Pouilly-Fumé),"The top Pouilly Fumé from Joseph Mellot is a complex wine with rich, rounded fruits touched by wood aging.

5973,5974,93,Ken Wright 2012 Guadalupe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Quite tart, with lemony acids, the Guadalupe is built upon a mineral base of wet stone and chalk.

5974,5975,93,La Rochelle 2010 Deer Meadows Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A high-elevation vineyard (1,700-feet) above Boonville, Deer Meadows imparts a subtle floral violet quality to this wine, which is lovingly faint in color and silky texture. Over time, the perfume builds into a singularly resolved mélange of dark blueberry and tart cherry, the acidity perfectly able to hit the high notes. This wine should be enjoyable through 2021–2024 minimum, making an incredible partner to mushroom risotto or spring lamb.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
5975,5976,93,Newsome-Harlow 2011 Herbert Vineyard Zinfandel (El Dorado County),"Winemaker Scott Klann combines with friend and fellow winemaker Marco Cappelli, the owner of Herbert Vineyard, to craft this celebration of elegant blackberry, jammy fruit, black pepper and licorice.

6003,6004,87,Leyda 2015 Lot 5 Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of starched sheets and lanolin show a hint of apple. This feels rather lean and similar to soda: there isn't much body to it.

6053,6054,94,Lachini 2011 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This Pinot seems to float weightlessly on the palate, yet the flavors sink in instantly and dazzle. Suggestions of raspberries and red cherries come spiced in white pepper and cinnamon, with richer levels of Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and red licorice, all highlighted with the most perfect acidity.

6056,6057,94,Syncline 2011 Cuvée Elena Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"With each new vintage of Cuvée Elena, the blend of grapes and vineyards grows more complex, the vines older, the flavors more compact and captivating.

6057,6058,94,Tegernseerhof 2012 Steinertal Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"Tightly closed like a fist, the only intimation of flavor is the seam of lemon-zest acidity.

6058,6059,94,Eichinger 2012 Gaisberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Lifted, lemony freshness mixes with lime zest on the nose.

6059,6060,94,Michele Satta 2010 Piastraia  (Bolgheri),"The wine blends Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet and Sangiovese in equal parts. Aromas of cedar, ripe black berries and plum almost jump from the glass.

6060,6061,94,Salomon-Undhof 2012 Steiner Kögl Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),"Tight but gently touched with ripe apple, lime and grapefruit, this wine is refreshing now, although it is still too closed to show its fuller fruits.

6062,6063,94,Schloss Gobelsburg 2012 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"Tight and slender on the palate, it has green and yellow citrus flavors in the foreground.

6063,6064,94,Terra Valentine 2010 Marriage Red (Spring Mountain District),"The 2010 vintage was a generally good one for the winery. Most of the Cabs were released last year, but they've held this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend back for extra time in the bottle. Yet it's still very tannic, stinging the gums with astringency. Underneath that is a beautiful wine, brimming with fresh blackberries and cassis, and an attractive green-olive note that's sweet and salty and umami-rich. Already throwing some sediment, this is a serious cellar candidate. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2018.",Anonymous,
6064,6065,94,Jurtschitsch 2012 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"What to remark on first: those hints of mellow, luscious ripeness of plum, peach and apple, or that zesty, breezy lemon acidity?

6065,6066,94,Loring Wine Company 2012 Clos Pepe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"There's a subtle difference between this Pinot and Loring's eight other vineyard-designated 2012 Pinots. But by a hair, this is the best and most compelling, delicious in blackberries, blueberries and cherries. It's hard not to drink the entire bottle now, with its tantalizing acidity and soft but intricate tannins. And yet this gorgeous wine will develop bottle complexity until 2020 or 2021. The vineyard is in the sweet spot of the Santa Rita Hills.",Anonymous,
6066,6067,94,Biondi Santi 2007 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Thanks to having some of the highest vineyards in Montalcino, Biondi Santi was able to make a stunning Riserva in the hot and forward 2007 vintage. It opens with aromas of forest floor and dried rose petals. The palate showcases concentrated wild cherry and cinnamon-spice flavors alongside bracing tannins.

6068,6069,88,Archery Summit 2004 Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is from the vineyard that surrounds the winery, and the bottling receives both Estate and Dundee Hills designations—best of the best. It's a pungent, pleasant wine upon entry, with rather pale strawberry fruit. It quickly moves through the midpalate and turns lean, with tomato leaf and green tea astringency. There is a slight impression of alcoholic heat. Though accessible and interesting, it somehow falls short of what it could/should be, given its provenance and price.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6069,6070,88,Viñedos Organicos Emiliana 2007 Natura Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"This is a fulfilling unoaked, organic wine from Chile's cool Casablanca Valley.

Breaks the mold and opens the door to a whole other style of Chardonnay.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6070,6071,88,Silvan Ridge 2005 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Forward and fruity, this has California-style fruit and sweet, strawberry candy. The difference is that it fills out the middle with some leafy, herbal flavors, nothing too rough, but enough to add some flavor interest. The finish is fat and buttery, showing the influence of oak aging.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6071,6072,88,WillaKenzie Estate 2004 Kiana Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Kiana bottling, named for the owners' granddaughter, is made with Dijon clones planted in 1996 and 1997. Initially quite tight and unyielding, it first opens into flavors of leaf, herb and green tea. Tucked neatly into the midpalate is a core of good red strawberry/cherry fruit. The tannins are earthy but not rough; everything here is balanced and well-managed; the alcohol a moderate 14.3%.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6072,6073,88,Groote Post 2004 The Old Man's Blend Red (Coastal Region),"Aromas of mint and white pepper are followed by a blend of red berry, savory spice and smoke.

6073,6074,88,Rocca di Montemassi 2005 Le Focaie  (Maremma),"Why reach for a lean, tart Chianti when you could have this varietally correct but friendlier Sangiovese? Aged half in stainless steel and half in large Slavonian oak casks, this wine's black cherry and plum fruit flavors are carried by soft tannins, but still show hints of tobacco leaf on the finish.",Anonymous,
6074,6075,88,Sineann 2006 Medici Vineyard Riesling (Willamette Valley),"This is done in a style that walks the line between Kabinett and Spatlese; it's just 11% alcohol but the fruit sweetness is largely hidden behind the tangy natural acids. It's got the mixed fruit flavors of peach, apricot, citrus and even a hint of tropical, along with the edgy definition of citrus peel that gives it a crisp finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6075,6076,88,Tenuta Oliveto 2005 Il Leccio Sangiovese (Toscana),"Here's a delightfully voluptuous and chewy Sangiovese from Montalcino in southern Tuscany that offers lavish layers of succulent cherry, plum, spice and natural rubber. Thick, ripe fruit aromas are elaborated by 15 months of oak aging that adds background dimension and renderings of vanilla, cinnamon and toasted almond. It's a soft, velvety wine with plush consistency and drying tannins that would pair beautifully with tender venison medallions, wild mushroom risotto or meat ragout.",Anonymous,
6076,6077,88,Eola Hills 2005 La Creole Reserve Chardonnay (Oregon),"The reserve Chardonnay from Eola Hills gets an extra year in bottle, and it has a more elegant, vertical structure, with the fruit framed in toasty oak flavors and some tarragon spice. It's persistent as well; the flavors seem to gather strength in the midpalate and continue through a strong and moderately complex finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6077,6078,88,Gypsy Dancer 2005 Broadley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"A tart, cranberry- and raspberry-flavored wine, this young, high-acid style of Pinot has a charming, Burgundian feeling to it. The snappy red fruits are underscored with citrus, and the balance is disarmingly light, but not simple or dull.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6078,6079,88,Gypsy Dancer 2005 Gary & Christine's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Aromatic with soda pop scents of Dr. Pepper, cola and root beer, this is nonetheless a reasonably substantial wine, not a simple fruit bomb.

6079,6080,88,Concha y Toro 2005 Amelia Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Sort of heavy, with touches of baked corn and hay. But it also has nice baked apple flavors and pretty good oak. On the finish, there's vanilla, almond, citrus and apple, and then very late comes hazelnut and even more vanilla. Drink now; it's not going to last much longer.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6080,6081,88,Farnese 2006 Opis Chardonnay (Terre di Chieti),"This is a fine example of a sun-drenched Chardonnay from central Italy that boasts a saturated, golden color and savory exotic fruit, vanilla, butter and natural rubber. It's viscous with streaks of glycerin that slowly make their way down the side of the glass and offers a creamy, sweet, sensation in the mouth.",Anonymous,
6081,6082,88,Château Bianca 2005 Cellar Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This brings a lot of flavor to the table for its relatively modest price. Round and spicy, it leads with juicy strawberry, cherry and apple pie fruit flavors.

6082,6083,88,Coelho 2005 Paciência Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Assertive and spicy, this interesting bottling, from Amity vineyard estate grapes, shows that even at just 13% alcohol Oregon Pinot can cut it. Made in a distinctive style that is clearly neither California nor Burgundy, this herbal, intense, wine puts the focus on the aromas, a beguiling mix of pine and herb. But the fruit is there right behind, tart and sassy, with cola and root beer notes sliding into a well-modulated but tannic finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6083,6084,88,Lemelson 2005 Thea's Selection Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Thea's Selection book-ends the single-vineyard wines and is the winery's lower-priced, multi-vineyard blend. As with the Jerome, the flavors are more complex and woven than in the single-vineyard bottlings; with cherry and berry fruit, fresh herb and streaks of bitter chocolate. It's a complete, supple wine, with no holes, moderately ripe fruit, and just a hint of heat in the finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6084,6085,90,Undurraga 2008 Altazor Red (Maipo Valley),"Fiery on first blush, this then displays aromas of plum, leather, tobacco and cheesy oak.

A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Syrah and Carignan.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6085,6086,90,Beaucanon 2009 Longwood Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A charming young Cabernet, this is rich in blackberry, currant and anise flavors that are complex and interesting. It's a very dry wine, but the fruit is so polished, it seems almost sweet. This is delicious now, although it's pretty tannic and could develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",Anonymous,
6086,6087,90,Viña Requingua 2007 Potro de Piedra Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc (Curicó Valley),"A classic Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon with aromas of lemon peel, olive and leafy fruit.

6179,6180,82,Polkura 2012 Aylin Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Bell pepper and cactus aromas announce greenness. It's also dilute in texture, with cucumber and arugula flavors. Not only is this high on pyrazines, it's past its prime.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6180,6181,82,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Dona Helena Colheita Rosé (Península de Setúbal),"Although this rosé smells of wild strawberries, the aroma is better than the palate, which tastes chemical with a bitter almond aftertaste. Serve very cold.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

6182,6183,81,Caraccioli 2010 Limited Production Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Green, vegetal flavors mar this wine. While it's nicely dry and crisp in acidity, and offers modest green apple and mango flavors, the unripeness is hard to like.",Anonymous,
6183,6184,80,Jack Creek 2011 Kruse Vineyards Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Tasted in early February, this Chardonnay had some secondary fermentation in the bottle, giving it a bubbly feeling. This major flaw may disappear in time.",Anonymous,
6184,6185,97,Tenuta San Guido 2010 Sassicaia  (Bolgheri Sassicaia),"This supremely elegant and age-worthy Sassicaia opens with an intense bouquet of black cherry, Mediterranean herbs, blue flower, cedar and leather aromas. Powerful but graceful, the palate delivers a vibrant core of black cherry accented with white pepper, mineral and balsamic notes alongside youthful but polished tannins and vibrant acidity. It's not as exuberant as some of its counterparts, but it may outlive all the other Bolgheri 2010s. Drink 2018–2040.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6185,6186,97,Le Macchiole 2010 Paleo Rosso Cabernet Franc (Toscana),"This extraordinary wine put Cabernet Franc on the map in Bolgheri.

6186,6187,95,Trefethen 2008 HaLo Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),"Trefethen has been on a roll the last few years, producing some of Napa's most spectacular Cabernets. This bottling, which contains minor quantities of Petit Verdot and Merlot, spent 28 months in new French oak barrels. The fruit is incredibly ripe and intense, with flavors of black currants and chocolate-covered cherries. As hard as the tannins are, they must have been even more aggressive two or three years ago, so kudos to Trefethen for holding the bottle back for five years. This beauty is just now beginning its long journey. Drink now–2020.",Anonymous,
6187,6188,95,C.H. Berres 2011 Ürziger Würzgarten Beerenauslese Riesling (Mosel),"Scents of honey and marmalade are accented with lemongrass and ginger on this exquisitely composed beerenauslese.

6188,6189,95,F X Pichler 2012 Loibner Steinertal Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),This is a rich and complex wine that shows spiced pear and a tense structure.

Iijima,
6190,6191,94,Sineann 2012 Yates Conwill Vineyard Pinot Noir,"Yates Conwill is next to the Resonance vineyard, which was just sold to Burgundy's Louis Jadot.

6191,6192,94,Williams Selyem 2011 Drake Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This small-production Chardonnay (only 272 cases) is exceptionally rich and ripe, as Williams Selyem Chardonnays consistently are. Intense flavors of tropical fruit and pear pie (with a smoky, buttery crust) make for a powerful palate. The acidity is mouthwatering. This is the ideal wine for cracked crab and a sourdough baguette with butter.",Anonymous,

6194,6195,94,Leeuwin Estate 2010 Art Series Chardonnay (Margaret River),"Having earned its reputation as one of Australia's finest Chardonnays, the challenge is then to maintain that level of quality. The 2010 Art Series certainly does that. Enticing aromas of woodsmoke, peach and pink grapefruit give way to intense flavors of citrus and stone fruit on the palate.

6196,6197,94,Penfolds 2008 St. Henri Shiraz (South Australia),"Like virtually all of Penfolds' top-end reds, this is full bodied and densely concentrated. As it's aged solely in large vats, there's no oak influence and the wine needs a bit of bottle age to come around. For now, it's a bit monolithic, showing hints of mint, black olive and ripe raspberries before ending long and fine. Drink 2017–2030, and perhaps beyond.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6197,6198,94,Prinz Salm 2011 Johannisberg Wallhausen Erste Lage Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Nahe),"Aromas of mango and candied-orange rind lend a heady tropical feel to this concentrated TBA full of peach and marmalade flavors.

6199,6200,94,Viña Cobos 2011 Bramare Marchiori Vineyard Malbec (Perdriel),"Among Cobos's high-end 2011 Malbecs, this one comes across as the most complete, layered and complex of the group. Aromas of fine oak and pencil lead augment blackberry and baked plum scents. The mouthfeel is smooth, round and rich, while flavors of tea, savory spices and black fruits dance long into the night.

6201,6202,94,F X Pichler 2012 Loibner Loibenberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"This is a wine that is so young.

6206,6207,92,Escarpment 2013 Te Rehua Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Martinborough),"Veteran winemaker Larry McKenna says Te Rehua consistently shows the most ripeness of his various single-vineyard wines.

6209,6210,92,Sparkman 2013 Wonderland Grenache (Yakima Valley),"Aromas of tobacco, dried herbs and strawberry are followed by focused, creamy-feeling raspberry and cranberry flavors. It shows a real sense of purity but the mouthfeel is where it truly shines.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
6210,6211,92,Stadlmann 2014 Anninger Zierfandler (Thermenregion),"Very faint peach notes break through the lemony freshness of this slender, golden wine. The usually richer, more sumptuous nature of Zierfandler shines through on the textured palate and in the glimpses of generous oiliness that flank the edges of the central citrus focus. This is lovely now but will reward cellaring. The finish is poised and clean-cut, lemony and long.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6211,6212,92,Stevens 2012 Stevens Timley Malbec (Yakima Valley),"It's unusual to see a Washington wine from this vintage at this listed alcohol level but there's no question about the ripeness.

6212,6213,92,Storm 2013 John Sebastiano Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"South African winemaker Ernst Storm is one to watch. This bottling offers a smoky, black raspberry nose, with hints of brown mustard and beef char.

Solid tannins ensure more interesting drinking 2017–2025.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
6213,6214,92,Tement 2014 Grassnitzberg Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),"A riper, more mature and rounded aspect characterizes this Sauvignon Blanc.

6214,6215,92,Veuve Doussot 2011 Cuvée Ernestine Millésime Brut  (Champagne),"Still young, this is a ripe fruit-driven wine.

6216,6217,92,Baxter 2012 Black Label Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A traditional and relatively light garnet color is the first sign that this is not a blatantly commercial wine. Savory, almost meaty, and cranberry-like aromas confirm the impression.

A great joy to drink.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6218,6219,92,Bründlmayer 2014 Berg Vogelsang Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"A savory note of yeast swings along the green pear and grapefruit peel notes on this totally brisk and refreshing Grüner.

6223,6224,92,Lecco 2011 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Direct and woody on the nose, with aromas of graphite and vanilla, this opens in fine form. A tight, pure palate deftly blends weight, fine acidity and chewy tannins, while the flavor profile is earthy and blackened by charred oak, with blackberry fruit and savory, peppery spice notes.

6224,6225,92,Fluteau 2008 Cuvée Symbiose Brut  (Champagne),"This impressive Champagne is rich while tight and mineral-textured.

Christopher 2014 Sandra Adele Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Principally blended from Abbey Ridge vineyard fruit, this offers red plum and cherry fruit, with a distinct streak of pineapple.

6349,6350,87,Coomber Family Ranch 2012 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This wine has an undeniable barbecue smokiness and curious suggestion of charcuterie, making for a savory, meaty opening.

6354,6355,87,Milbrandt 2012 The Estates Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"Aromas of cocoa and coffee are mixed with black licorice and dark berries, with this wine showing some reduction out of the gate that detracts.

6355,6356,87,Millbrook 2014 Lollipop Hill Estate Bottled Tocai Friulano (Hudson River Region),"Tropical fruit and floral notes abound on this intensely perfumed white.

It offers bursting berry flavors and very polished but firm tannins.",Anonymous,
6360,6361,88,Cascina Luisin 2004 Rabajà  (Barbaresco),Rabajà is among the most celebrated single vineyards in Barbaresco. The cru is known for its elegant yet muscular wines that perform well either aged or when drunk young. This expression exhibits notes of raspberry and cherry with shadings of vanilla and spice.

6361,6362,88,JR Wine 2006 Boschetti Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Big, ripe and juicy, with some overripenes veering into raisins, but it gives a rich plummy edge to the wild berries, tobacco and spice. Drink this impressive Zinfandel with roasts and beef stews.",Anonymous,
6362,6363,88,Youngberg Hill Vineyards 2006 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"A reserve selection from the winery's Jordan Block, this brings similar flavors with slightly more intensity.

6363,6364,88,Whitehall Lane 2005 Leonardini Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Made for the long haul, this 100% Cab was fermented in 100% new French oak. Right now, it's a hard, tannic wine, with little to relieve the astringency. The dominant flavors are of primary fruit black currants and sweet, charred wood. The score reflects the current drinkability, but it's a wine that could improve dramatically over the years.",Anonymous,
6364,6365,88,Pierre Sparr 2003 Presitge Pinot Noir (Alsace),"Developed aromas of forest floor and mushrooms come as no surprise, given the deep brick color on this Alsace Pinot. The highly nuanced palate is complex and shot through with mineral notes. Cherry cola flavors dominate the long finish. An excellent foil for squab or other game birds.",Anonymous,
6365,6366,88,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2004 Costa Grimaldi  (Barolo),"Costa Grimaldi tastes fruity and tart and offers mature notes of raspberry and strawberry over subtle shadings of spice, licorice and root beer. It's definitely a riper expression of Barolo and therefore not as layered or complex as other wines from this vintage. That said, it's a fine wine with super-firm tannins and bright cherry flavors.",Anonymous,
6366,6367,88,Roagna 2004 Vigna Rionde  (Barolo),"Vigna Rionda is among the finest crus in the Serralunga d'Alba area with 40- to 60-year-old vines and this producer takes a traditional approach to Barolo. It opens with a slightly brownish hue and seems older than the vintage thanks to aromas of old spice, used leather and dried herbs. The mouthfeel is raw, but firm.",Anonymous,
6367,6368,88,Selene 2007 Hyde Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Carneros),"Rich and creamy, with opulent pineapple and peppery spice flavors finished with a savory edge of lemongrass. High acidity works in the wine's favor, making it mouthwatering.",Anonymous,
6368,6369,88,Siduri 2006 Hawk's View Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Kudos to Siduri for offering a serious Oregon Pinot Noir at alcohol levels (13%) reminiscent of Burgundy. It's a welcome tilt for the state that once was tagged as the new world's Burgundian hope, but which has sometimes seemed more like a California wannabe.

6369,6370,88,Siduri 2006 Shaw Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This bottling brings strawberry preserves right up front; it's a light and spicy wine with immediate appeal. There's plenty of acid—rarely an issue in Oregon—but not much depth. It's got fruit and malted chocolate, and the finish lasts a bit longer than you might expect from the light fruit.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6370,6371,88,Dão Sul 2005 Monte da Cal Reserva Red (Alentejano),"Herbal, almost medicinal aromas set a complex scene for this densely structured wine. The flavors throughout, while rich, are also severe, a wrinkle on the otherwise ripe façade. That certainly suggests aging, and the dry tannins support this. In the meantime, it is a winter wine, its concentration needing rich meat dishes.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6371,6372,88,Barale Fratelli 2004 Bussia  (Barolo),"Bussia is among the best-regarded crus of Barolo and Sergio Barale's interpretation is definitely on the ripe side. You'll get aromas of mature strawberry and blackberry preserves backed by spice, licorice and anise. The overall effect is thick and chunky and the wine ends with firm astringency.",Anonymous,
6372,6373,88,Ca'Romè 2006 Maria di Brün  (Barbaresco),"This is a subdued and somewhat neutral expression of Nebbiolo with measured aromas of black fruit, plum, black currant and moist earth. The wine is definitely more lively in the mouth where it picks up points thanks to its firm disposition and lingering flavors of blackberry and smoke.",Anonymous,
6373,6374,88,Dos Victorias 2006 José Pariente Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),"Peach, melon and apple aromas are more or less what's left on the nose, and the palate also indicates a fine wine in decline. Nobody will tell you that Verdejo has the stuff for long aging, but Pariente remains a wine of refinement and complexity. So catch it now for the last of its melon, green-fruit and pear flavors, which are backed by a lasting but soft finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6374,6375,88,Quinta das Bandeiras 2005 Passagem Red (Douro),"A new joint venture between winemaker Jorge Moreira and owner the Bergqvist family, both of Quinta de la Rosa.

Bone dry, it will live for many years.",Anonymous,
6377,6378,85,Silvan Ridge 2009 Lazy River Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This modest Pinot offers light strawberry fruit, a dash of cola, and a component of earth and stem that overtakes the finish. It hints at green tannins, with a bit of brown sugar sweetness, perhaps from aging in 30% new oak.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6378,6379,85,Terra Serena NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"This simple Extra Dry Prosecco Superiore opens with peach, nectarine, simple lines and a watery mouthfeel. The sparkler's momentum is achieved mostly by the creaminess of its bubbles.",Anonymous,

6383,6384,84,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2009 Má Partilha Merlot (Península de Setúbal),"Despite its alcohol and potential richness, this has as much green, herbal character as fruitiness. It's structured and juicy, and shows considerable acidity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6384,6385,84,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2012 JP Azeitão Rosé (Península de Setúbal),"This fruity, perfumed wine (the Moscatel Roxo in the blend sees to that), is ripe and full bodied, with some light sweetness giving a soft, gentle aftertaste. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6385,6386,84,Bodegas Navarro López 2011 Rojo Granrojo Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Ripe, lightly spiced black cherry and berry aromas announce a good but basic wine.

6386,6387,84,Cecilia Beretta 2011 Brognoligo  (Soave Classico),"Yes, this wine treads deep on the side of informality with a lean, watery mouthfeel and subtle aromas of peach and pear. But there's also just enough territorial identity of Mediterranean herb and dried sage to make it interesting. The price is just right too.",Anonymous,
6387,6388,84,Colter's Creek 2011 Colter's Creek Estate Riesling (Idaho),"The aromas seem a bit muddled, with notes of jasmine and pear occasionally poking through and the alcohol showing itself. It's medium sweet (2.7% residual sugar) finishing a touch bitter.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport

6395,6396,84,Telmo Rodríguez 2008 Altos Lanzaga Gran Viñedo  (Rioja),"From a mediocre vintage, it seems as though the winery poured on the fully toasted oak to cover up marginal fruit.

6406,6407,88,Friedeman 2013 Dichotomy Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is a rocking price for the quality of the wine, a small-production crafting of well-grown grapes in a great year.

6407,6408,88,Radford Dale 2012 Frankenstein Pinotage (Stellenbosch),"Floral aromas of violet, carnation and rose water open the bouquet of this wine, framing the core of muddled black berries and cherries.

6438,6439,88,Testarossa 2012 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),"This begins with a reserved nose that unfolds into deep, black aromas of licorice, turned earth and graphite. Pomegranate and acai fruit flavors mix with red clay and touches of whiskey, but the tannins are powerful. Give it until at least 2018 to smooth out.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
6439,6440,88,Côté Mas NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant de Limoux),"The aromas of this pretty, refreshing rosé are delicate and subtle at first.

6445,6446,88,Dominio IV 2009 Midnight Skies Estate Tempranillo (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Though already five years old, this wine still seems to need time.

6457,6458,88,Dominio IV 2011 Technicolor Bat Three Sleeps Vineyard Tempranillo-Syrah Red (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Though the blend leans heavily toward Tempranillo, it's the Syrah (16%) that shows itself with its notes of black pepper and smoked meat.

6460,6461,87,Gary Farrell 2001 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"If you like yours big and burly, then this might be the right wine for you. Applesauce and lemon meringue pie aromas lead the way toward a palate full of lemon, pineapple, tangerine and vanilla. The finish is stony and leaves a custard-like impression. It's clearly from the barrel-fermented school, but for some that may be fine. For others, however, it will feel overoaked and ponderous on the tongue.",Anonymous,
6461,6462,87,Lacheteau 2000 Sancerre  (Sancerre),"Cleaner than the producer's Pouilly-Fumé, with gooseberry and popping citrus aromas, this wine is still a bit lean. But it does offer nice grapefruit and green apple flavors atop a very tight structure. All in all, it's crisp and easy to drink, which is what a basic Sancerre should be.",Anonymous,
6462,6463,87,St. Michael-Eppan 2000 Sanct Valentin Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige),"Sharp aromas of citrus mix with the odd note of petrol. Lime and apple-skin flavors fade into an acid-driven, orange-flavored finish that's also musky and quite long. While not initially appealing, this wine opens up with airing to reveal some hidden qualities.",Anonymous,
6463,6464,87,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2000 Rancho Chimiles Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Starts off with mineral, lemon and anise aromas that develop on the palate into dried spices, ground flint and lime. It's light in body, yet finishes strong, with clean citrus flavors and a lasting sensation of powdery talc.",Anonymous,
6464,6465,87,Stonestreet 1999 Upper Barn Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"In line with this winery's penchant for oak, this fast-aging wine is buttery and heavily toasted. As a result, snappy apple or citrus fruit is harder to find than many might want it to be. Nevertheless, there's some bold lemon and creamy vanilla on the thick, mouthfilling palate. And for that, it earns points.",Anonymous,
6465,6466,87,Valley View 1999 Anna Maria - Old Stage Vineyard Merlot (Rogue Valley),"A pretty nose, plummy and rich, with a nice toasty, roasted finish.

6466,6467,87,King Estate 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Oregon),"Smells oaky, with smoky vanilla and sweet, charred notes riding high over flamboyant tropical fruit aromas, including guavas and breadfruit. This is a big wine, but the pieces aren't all in place. It's like a symphony orchestra playing different tunes. Give it a few months to knit together.",Anonymous,
6467,6468,87,Biondi Santi 2000 Sassoalloro Sangiovese (Toscana),"This Sangiovese has a lot going for it: a sweet maple-tinged aroma, a pretty ruby color, round but snappy plum and raspberry flavors, and a long, layered finish. But in the end it doesn't really sing, it's a bit hollow at the core, and there's an oak-driven, buttered popcorn note on the finish that leaves a heavy, lasting flavor.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6468,6469,87,Iron Horse 1999 T Bar T Cuvée R Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"This 14.5% bruiser contains 20% Viognier, which adds a tropical fruit character to the nose and palate. The mouthfeel is soft, with flavors heavy on banana and melon. Woody characteristics such as nuttiness, particularly almonds, also pop up. To its detriment, the oak and fruit seem to be fighting each other more than complementing one another.",Anonymous,
6469,6470,87,Girardet 2001 Estate Riesling (Umpqua Valley),"A lot of shale in the soils adds interest to this elegant, light, fairly soft wine. Off-dry and balanced, it represents good value.

6470,6471,87,Castello Banfi 1999 Cum Laude Sangiovese (Sant'Antimo),"This is a new kitchen-sink offering from Banfi, featuring Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah. It goes full bore on the red fruit and oak, with spicy berry aromas and cherry flavors. The tannins are pretty hard, and with ample acids, this young wine currently starches the cheeks. But in three years it should become a good to very good table wine.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6471,6472,87,Domaine A. Cailbourdin 2000 Le Cris  (Pouilly-Fumé),"This wine is so typical of the area. It's defined by a stony, dry nose, citrus and tropical fruit flavors, a lean, tight finish and mouth-cleaning acids. It's hardly the deepest, most complex wine you'll find, but not all good wines have to be complicated.",Anonymous,
6472,6473,87,Morandé 2001 Terrarum Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Rustic, as Carmenère should be, this single-valley offering is a good drink-with-barbecue bet.

Woodsy, briary notes and ample spice give oomph to the juicy berry finish.",Anonymous,
6473,6474,87,Rowland 2000 Jill's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Central Otago),"Smoky, meaty and spicy, this wine boasts plenty of oak influence. The red berry fruit is somewhat subdued, with the flavors centered on earth and spice. Though lean, the mouthfeel is admirably silky, and pretty cranberry shadings appear on the finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6474,6475,87,Quivira 1999 Fig Tree Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"This wine has a dairy note to the nose; i.e., cheese, custard and yogurt. Lemony flavors are accented by dried baking spices, while the back palate is a touch chalky, offering some good and welcome grip. Overall, the wine seems a bit heavy. If it were pushing amps, it would be a high-power machine.",Anonymous,
6475,6476,87,Valley View 1999 Anna Maria - Quail Run Merlot (Rogue Valley),"A softer, more forward style than the Old Stage, showing more density and soft tannins. Light cherry fruit, good balance, texture, weight. Some hints of wood, earth and mineral too.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6476,6477,87,Valley View 2000 Anna Maria Chardonnay (Oregon),"Lots of ripe apple and tropical fruits, lots of butterscotch and caramel flavors, but not too heavy. Good balance, good acids, a very appealing, forward style which isn't too oaky or heavy for food.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

6481,6482,93,Louis Latour 2010 Château Corton Grancey  (Corton),"A firm, powerful wine, its tannins still very dominant. Acidity is a factor, along with deep red-plum fruit.

6484,6485,93,Domaine Vincent Girardin 2010 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"Wood and ripe fruit flavors drive this explosively fruity wine.

If you like a heavily toasted, resiny type of full-bodied Chardonnay, add two or three points. If you absolutely hate that style, then subtract a few points.

6601,6602,81,flipflop NV Headshrinker Sweet Red Blend Red (California),"This is sweet and simple, but its slight burn on the finish makes it harder to swallow.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6602,6603,81,Santa Ema 2011 Selected Terroir Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),"Other than notes of white flowers and green herbs on the nose, this wine is all about canned peas and beans. The palate has texture and flesh, but the flavors are vegetal.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

6605,6606,80,Muscardini 2009 Gracie Creek Vineyards Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"This tastes barely ripe, with a vegetal flavor compromsing the chocolate and cherry notes. It's soft, making it fall a little flat in the mouth.",Anonymous,
6606,6607,96,Rochioli 2010 West Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"We can quibble over whether the cherries are red or black, or if it's persimmons or pomegranates, or if the mushrooms are fresh or sautéed, but that's the point. This wine is so complex, it initiates discussion. Fine acidity and rich tannins provide structure, and although the wine is silky enough to enjoy now, you really want to give it 6–8 years.",Anonymous,
6607,6608,96,Riglos 2009 Gran Corte Las Divas Vineyard Red (Tupungato),"This wine takes you on a trip to an outer wine world where deep, cushioned berry aromas come with exotic perfumes, bath oils and crushed flower petals. It's ultrasaturated and jammy, but not clunky or heavy. This tastes like a storm of blackberry, espresso and Swiss chocolate, while black spices and length bring up the rear. A blend of 50% Malbec, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cab Franc; drink now–2017.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6608,6609,96,Celani Family Vineyards 2008 Ardore Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Young and succulent, this is fresh, with ripe flavors of blackberries, cassis, chocolate and herb, with a toasty overlay of oak. Powerful, but not overbearing, this shows an internal coherence that lifts it to a high level of elegant complexity. As good as it is, it will benefit from 8-12 years in a proper cellar.",Anonymous,
6609,6610,95,Laird 2009 Flat Rock Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is dry and brisk in acidity, with firm tannins and great structural integrity. At the same time, it's vast in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, while the oak overlay is strong but perfectly matched with the wine's volume. Very fine, complex and elegant, this is a Cabernet to cellar for eight years; it could be one for the long haul.",Anonymous,
6610,6611,86,McGregor 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Warm spice and oak tones accent fresh apples and lemons on this full-bodied Chardonnay. It's not subtle with a dense slick of caramel that extends along the midpalate, but a kick of lemon-lime acidity on the finish adds some levity.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6611,6612,86,McIntyre Vineyards 2012 Kimberly Merlot (Arroyo Seco),"Aromas of freshly cracked pepper and boysenberry introduce this wine. Once sipped, the promised complexity slips away, with plum flavors and even tannins but not much lingering finish. Serve with burgers and meatloaf.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
6612,6613,86,Ànima Negra 2013 Quíbia Falanis White (Vi de la Terra Mallorca),"This funky white from the island of Mallorca is 50% Premsal and 50% Callet, and if you've never heard of those grapes you're not alone. The nose is a bit harsh and strange, while the palate is on the flat side. Flavors of ham, pithy citrus and nectarine finish jumbled. This is more of a unique oddity than great white wine.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6613,6614,86,Bodegas Franco-Españolas 2009 Rioja Bordón Crianza  (Rioja),"Roasted, slightly stalky aromas override the wine's traditional dry fruit and tomato scents.

This contains 20% Graciano along with Tempranillo.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

6615,6616,86,Terre del Principe 2010 Piancastelli Red (Terre del Volturno),"This thick, extracted wine is made from 70% Pallagrello and 30% Casavecchia grapes, a portion of which was overripened on the vine. It opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, oak, toast, prune and vanilla.

6616,6617,86,Three Rivers 2013 Rosé Cabernet Franc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This tangy rosé opens with a burst of tart strawberry fruit, and rolls into a lightly creamy midpalate.

6617,6618,86,Clos des Rocs 2012 Clos des Rocs Monopole  (Pouilly-Loché),"The wine is soft, fruity and ready to drink, with attractive fruitiness, soft acidity and a touch of wood. With a crisp aftertaste, it offers freshness as well.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6618,6619,86,Collovray et Terrier 2012 Les Vignes de Joanny  (Mâcon-Davayé),"A tight, mineral-driven wine, it has both great fruit and acidity. It is tangy, pushing forward crisp lemon and apple skin flavors and a touch of peach. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6619,6620,86,Corvo 2012 Rosso Red (Terre Siciliane),"A juicy blend of Nero d'Avola and Nerello Mascalese, this wine offers blackberry and black cherry flavors in a friendly, easy-drinking style. It's perfect for everyday dinners and informal occasions.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6620,6621,86,Di Giovanna 2012 Poggionotte Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane),"Made from organically grown grapes, this opens with earthy aromas of tilled earth and ripe black fruit.

6621,6622,86,Domaine Pouillon 2013 Jewett Creek Vineyards Gewürztraminer (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"This wine is 100% varietal and fermented and aged in stainless steel.

Sullivan,@wawinereport
6622,6623,86,Edna Valley Vineyard 2012 Fleur de Edna Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"A deeply golden Chardonnay from E & J Gallo's Edna Valley brand, this wine starts with a tightly wound nose, faintly offering tart apple, lemon rind and a slight herbal character.

6625,6626,86,Hedonismo 2012 Blanco White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Mild, innocuous aromas of white fruits are pleasant but undefined. This feels round and benefits from acidic lift, while flavors of orange and nectarine finish in a friendly manner. This is mostly Viura with some Verdejo and Sauvignon Blanc.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6626,6627,86,Felix Callejo 2011 Flores de Callejo  (Ribera del Duero),"This is black as night, concentrated and shows aromas of asphalt, lemon peel and blackberry. The palate is round and soft, with mellow tannins. The flavor profile is very ripe and focuses on prune and blackberry, while the finish is loamy in feel, with a licorice hint.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6627,6628,85,Wagner 2012 Select Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Fleshy and ripe with flavors of sweet yellow peach touched with honey, this is an easy going medium-sweet Riesling. There's a touch of savory smoke and spice that persists from nose to finish, but overall, it's bright and sunny with lingering lemon acidity.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6628,6629,91,Casa da Passarella 2011 Abanico Reserva Red (Dão),"Powerfully structured and concentrated, this is a rich, tarry and tannic wine.

Drink from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6629,6630,91,Kangarilla Road 2012 The Devil's Whiskers Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Is there any doubt that 2012 is a superb vintage for South Australian Shiraz? Here's another fine example, boasting sumptuous levels of black cherry fruit framed by hints of brown sugar, roasted meat, cinnamon and allspice. It's full-bodied and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish. Drink 2018–2030.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6630,6631,91,Yalumba 2014 Made with Organic Grapes Viognier (South Australia),"On top of being made from organically grown grapes, this wine is vegan friendly.

Drink this full-bodied, slightly open-knit wine over through 2017.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6631,6632,91,Herdade do Esporão 2014 Esporão Private Selection White White (Alentejano),"It's rare to find a Sémillon in Portugal, let along the Alentejo. And yet the wine works beautifully. Wood aging has given it sophistication while the natural creamy texture of the grape is enhanced by the ripe yellow fruits that are lightly lifted by a herbal, citrus aftertaste. This wine could well age, so drink now or, better, keep until 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6632,6633,91,Hirsch 2012 Block 8 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A seductive smoky, earthy aroma leads to big and tart cranberry and raspberry flavors, surrounded by a velvety blanket of fine tannins that make the wine lip-smacking and mouthwatering. There is somewhat more frame than filling, so this will appeal more to fans of tension and elegance than power.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
6633,6634,91,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2013 Wineck-Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Pure notes of tart but ripe, red apple shine on nose and palate. They pervade this fresh, clean and dry wine with immense, appetizing juiciness. There is concentration and joy at the heart, backed by focussed, taut acidity that brightens everything. The lemon zest on the finish is impressive and long.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6634,6635,91,Cave de Ribeauvillé 2011 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Honeysuckle spice wraps itself around luscious, ripe, sweet peach fruit.

6635,6636,91,Cristom 2012 Sommers Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This wine has pleasing richness, lending warmth across a full palate. Forward berry and cherry flavors fill the mouth, offering an accessible burst of fresh flavor in a somewhat blocky frame. There's a jolt of spice and a streak of cola, all quite tasty. The wine spent 19 months in 53% new French oak.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6636,6637,91,Cristom 2013 Mount Jefferson Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Pretty is the word that comes to mind upon sniffing and sipping this wine, with its beguiling strawberry and cherry fruit. It gathers strength in its core, while maintaining an elegant, well-structured acid/tannin frame. It's an outstanding value in Oregon Pinot from a top producer.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6637,6638,91,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2011 Steingrubler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Faint rose petal notes still perfume the peachy fruit. The palate is rich, medium sweet and honeyed, as though peach and citrus were soaked in honey. This is fresh and rich, rounded and poised, tipping the scales just a little bit more on the rich side. The spice on the finish is reminiscent of honeysuckle.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6638,6639,91,Domaine Fernand Engel 2013 Gloeckelberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The bitter-sweet edge of dark fir honey engulfs nose and palate which nonetheless has a core of bright, ripe, juicy and slightly sweet pear. The sweetness sings with that bitter tinge. This is rich but fresh and balanced and leaves with an off-dry aftertaste of more honey.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6639,6640,91,Domaine Laporte 2014 La Comtesse  (Sancerre),"Produced from vines located between Chavignol and Sancerre, this comes from pure chalk soil. It is crisp while having a warmer, more rounded character. It's full of apple and pineapple as well as citrus fruits which are added to the young, tight mineral texture. Aromatic and ripe, the wine should age a year or two and will be better from 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6640,6641,91,Domaine Serene 2012 Two Barns Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Broad berry/cherry fruit flavors open up quickly, with lighter accents of compost and leather. This is a smooth, somewhat loose-knit wine, with pretty baking spices decorating the finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6641,6642,91,Domaine Serene NV R Dry Rosé (Oregon),"The current edition of this nonvintage rosé is a blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.

6642,6643,91,Domaine Vincent Carême 2013 L'Ancestrale Brut  (Vouvray),"With a nutty flavor fresh apples and pears and a touch of honey, this is a delicious wine. It is full of ripe fruit that has not lost its crisp, cool character. The wine has a mineral edge that gives it a fine tang as well as a tight texture. It's fresh although there are indications of bottle age which means it is ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6643,6644,91,Dr. Bürklin-Wolf 2014 Wachenheimer Böhling P.C. Dry Riesling (Pfalz),"Minerality takes center stage in this light-footed but penetrating dry Riesling. While the fruit profile is zesty and green—suggesting tart, under-ripe lime, tangerines and melon rinds—the palate is gilded by slick layers of candlewax and petrol, lending a dense, voluminous mouthfeel. It's an elegant, stately wine to drink now through 2023.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6644,6645,91,Dr. Loosen 2014 Bernkasteler Lay Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"More blossomy and mineral than ripe or ruddy, there's a demure elegance to this bristling off-dry Riesling. Crisp, almost crystalline flavors of tangerine and yellow peach accentuate and lengthen the palate. It's a deftly cutting wine to drink now through 2020.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6645,6646,91,Max Ferd. Richter 2008 Mülheimer Sonnenlay Brut Sekt Riesling (Mosel),"Wide streaks of saffron, caramel and honey along with a deep mineral core hint to the maturity of this complex sparkling Riesling. Rich yellow cherry and peach flavors persist on the palate, buoyed by soft, delicate mousse and striking lemonade acidity.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6646,6647,91,Pelter 2013 Matar Petit Verdot (Jerusalem Hills),"Violet red in the glass, this wine features a bouquet of cherry, violet and vanilla. Flavors of cherry, blueberry, anise, ground black pepper and green bell pepper are fixed in a framework of tannins that offer full mouthfeel right into the orange peel finish.",Mike DeSimone,@worldwineguys
6647,6648,91,Penner-Ash 2013 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This fragrant, musky wine is scented with dried rose petals, spiced cranberries, pepper and chocolate. It rolls comfortably into a full-bodied core with cherry cobbler, medium length and polished tannins.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6648,6649,91,Puramun 2013 Reserva Malbec (Valle de Uco),"Right away, this smells smooth and complete, with a proper mix of berry fruit, oak and earthy aromas. This is Salentein winemaker José Galante's personal wine, and it's juicy on the palate and doesn't overreach. Blackberry, boysenberry and salty, meaty notes finish with a persistent dose of salt, which should make this all the more appropriate when served with beef. Drink through 2022.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6649,6650,91,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2013 Reserva Red (Tejo),"The wine is ripe, still young with its fresh fruits and acidity. The elements are all there to produce a dark and dense wine that has fine structure. It's a complex blend of Alfrocheiro, Syrah and Touriga Nacional, all of which will allow the wine to age over a good few years. Drink this impressive wine from 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6650,6651,91,Quinta da Romeira 2013 Morgado de Santa Catherina Reserva Arinto (Bucelas),"This pure Arinto from its home territory is fresh, fruity, citrus-driven and with apple and textured zesty orange flavors. The wine has structure, intense acidity and a tangy, mineral character that will allow it to mature a few more months. Drink now, but better from late 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6651,6652,91,Radikon 2012 Slatnik White (Venezia Giulia),"Made with 80% Chardonnay and 20% Friulano, this amber-colored wine boasts more fruit richness than many other wines from the orange wine movement. Loaded with ripe apricot, candied citrus zest, dried herbs and crushed stone, this is brightened by lively acidity on the palate. A perfect introduction to the genre; Drink now–2016.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6652,6653,91,Rocca 2012 Collinetta Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),"A foundation of thick tannin and oak give size and weight to this full-bodied wine that offers waves of smoky leather, cedar, tar and black cherry on the nose and palate. More savory than fruity, it is a compelling expression of this relatively cooler appellation in the Napa Valley. Drink now through 2020.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6653,6654,91,Rocca 2012 Grigsby Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"This wine opens in classically delicate characteristics of clove and cedar, as expressive as a forest floor.

6654,6655,86,Marko 2011 Kortezubi Urdaibai Hondarrabi Zuri (Bizkaiko Txakolina),"Despite being fairly young, this is a weighty wine with a gold color and waxy apple aromas. A blocky mouthfeel is oily and has enough acidity to stay lively. Flavors of chunky apple, peach and melon lead to a round, oily feeling finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6655,6656,86,Edwin Dyer 2011 Le Cadeau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Sharply herbal, this shows a bit of a green edge, which comes across as bitterness on the finish. The pale red-fruit flavors hint at thistle and bramble more than ripe berry, but the balance is there to carry the wine well with food.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6656,6657,86,Eristavi Winery 2012 Vintner's Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Made in a family winery based in San Francisco that sources fruit mainly from Lodi, this Sauvignon Blanc is rich with fig and Nilla Wafer notes, with a pretty, floral nose.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6657,6658,86,Fiuza 2012 Native Tinto Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo),"This is a fruity, wood-aged wine, showing spice and coffee flavors that complement ripe blackberry fruit. It's smooth in texture and has just the right touch of acidity. The wine is ready to drink. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6658,6659,86,Foris 2011 Maple Ranch Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley),"Considering the coolness of the vintage, this wine seems surprisingly ripe with notes of cherry, strawberry, herbs and ash. It's thick and weighty in feel, making it seem a bit ponderous.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
6659,6660,86,Lancaster 2012 Samantha's Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"Lavish barrel fermentation, aging in new French oak and sur lie stirring was intended to bring out a Bordeaux-style richness in this wine. But the chilly vintage intervened, yielding a wine with dominant green peppercorn aromas and flavors. Still, it's a subtle, elegant wine. Drink now.",Anonymous,
6660,6661,86,Louis Sipp NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Fragrant wine, attractively perfumed, crisply fresh. It is full of ripe apples, layered with intense acidity and balanced with a warmer peach flavor. Ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6661,6662,86,Hilanda 2009 Término de Arriba Monastrell (Jumilla),"Black fruit, clove, char and mocha are the primary aromas on this heavily oaked, saturated Monastrell.

6662,6663,86,Hill Wine Company 2011 Black Dog Series Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Its brisk acidity and dry, tart lemon-and-lime flavors make this a nice wine to drink now. It has the herb and tobacco notes you often find in Napa Valley Chardonnay.",Anonymous,
6663,6664,86,Cave de Cleebourg NV Clérotstein Rosé Brut Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),"Very creamy mousse leads to a tight wine with raspberry flavors and considerable acidity.

6664,6665,86,DFJ Vinhos 2012 Coreto Branco White (Lisboa),"Fragrant and fruity, this is a bright, crisp and clean wine that's totally ready to drink. Lively, with a cool feeling like the nearby ocean's breezes, it finishes with light acidity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6665,6666,86,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2011 Espirito Tinto Red (Tejo),Spice notes from wood aging gives this wine a rounded character. Ripe berry fruits show strongly so drink soon while its fruitiness lasts. Screwcap.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
6666,6667,82,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2013 Menguante Garnacha (Cariñena),"Dark and ominous in color, with a grapy, rustic, smoky nose, this Garnacha is high in acid, rubbery and tannic on the palate. Semisour black-plum flavors finish equally tannic and acidic.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach

6668,6669,81,Viña Casas Patronales 2013 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),"This is overtly rustic, roasted, leathery and strange on the nose. A wide but wayward palate seems sluggish, while rubbery black-fruit and burnt-wood flavors finish with murky berry tones.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6669,6670,81,Terra Andina 2012 Bold Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Aromas of spiced tomato, clove and rubber gloves don't click or suggest much quality. A cloying, sugary palate with mucky berry flavors is less than stellar, as is a sticky finish that tastes like strawberry jam.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6670,6671,81,La Crusset 2011 La Bella Fernanda Tempranillo Blanco (Rioja),"Rough, stalky, yeasty aromas are all over the map. Lemony acidity renders this tight as a drum, while bitter, stalky flavors finish wheaty and bitter. This Tempranillo Blanco is barely worth a go; the pleasure factor is at base level.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6671,6672,81,Coto de Hayas 2012 Fagus Selección Especial Garnacha (Campo de Borja),"Odd aromas of clove are smoky but mostly come across as weird and forced. This has a lactic, creamy mouthfeel with soft edges. The flavor profile is all wood, and resiny, clove-driven wood at that. A severely sweet, cloying, resiny finish is a lot to deal with.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6672,6673,81,Estampa 2014 Fina Reserva Ensamblaje Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay-Viognier White (Colchagua Valley),"Pickled, briny aromas lead to a palate defined only by pithy citrus fruit. This tastes mostly of bitter citrus, while the finish brings herbacious tones.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6673,6674,80,Arrocal 2014 Rosa de Arrocal Rosé (Ribera del Duero),"Feral, feline, sweaty aromas precede an awkward palate with bitter flavors of weedy berry, citrus fruits and pyrazines. A scallion-like quality drives the finish on this strange, bitter rosé.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6674,6675,80,Sembro 2012 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero),"Right away this goes wrong; the nose is smothered with charred, burning oak that smells harsh and like chemicals. A tannic, resiny palate is barely acceptable, as are bitter, burnt, resiny blackberry flavors.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6675,6676,80,Teillery 2014 Organic Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"This smells forced and grapy, with murky undertones. Flabby on the palate, this organic red tastes nutty and earthy. An aftertaste of mulch and peanut is off base and highly questionable.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6676,6677,98,Williams Selyem 2013 Westside Road Neighbors Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Seductively smooth and intriguingly aromatic, this blend of several knock-out vineyards along Westside Road—Allen, Bacigalupi, Bucher, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem Estate—is instantly delicious, sharing a concentration of cherry, strawberry and citrus that perfectly captures the essence of the fruit, accented by a tease of black tea. An earthy minerality wraps around dry, polished tannins, with a streak of just-right acidity, giving it a realm of juiciness and flavorful sophistication. Enjoy through 2023.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6677,6678,97,Ramey 2012 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This wine is deliciously elegant yet decadently rich in all the right ways, from a prime, longtime vineyard source planted to vines over 40 years old. Honeyed apple comes to the fore amid lush, formidable layers of complexity and high-minded pursuit, never getting bogged down, the minerality perfectly pitched and the oak fully integrated.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6678,6679,96,F X Pichler 2013 Dürnsteiner Liebenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"A delightful citrus scent intrigues, suggesting yuzu or mandarin. The palate is richer and introduces notions of earth and that pithy, phenolic edge of serious Grüner Veltliner. The initial citrus on the nose returns with redoubled force on the streamlined, fresh and still tightly closed palate. Give this time to unwind, so that the fruit can fully express itself. The deliciously green- and orange-tinged finish promises everything. Drink from 2017.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6679,6680,96,Le Macchiole 2010 Messorio Merlot (Toscana),"Earthy aromas of tilled soil, truffle, leather, black cherry and cedar lead the nose on this rich but elegant wine. The concentrated, smooth palate delivers juicy blackberry, black currant, freshly ground peppercorn, licorice, milk chocolate and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. Stunning and delicious, it's already drinking beautifully but it will also maintain for years. Drink through 2025.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6680,6681,96,Williams Selyem 2013 Olivet Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Silky, with pronounced tannins that should mellow in time, this is an earthy, stemmy and perfumed wine. Succulent and balanced, it's brightly exuberant in black cherry yet brooding and complex throughout, changing slightly from savory to floral and back again. It's an incredible wine out of the gate; cellar with confidence, through 2021.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6681,6682,96,Ramey 2012 Woolsey Road Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This wine comes from a new vineyard source for the producer, who continues to astound with Chardonnay. The site rises to well-crafted heights in the winemaker's hands. Made in a small quantity, the wine offers zesty lemon intensity and concentrated acidity, the entire balanced experience rewarding in its bright complexity.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6682,6683,96,Emmerich Knoll 2012 Ried Loibenberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Lusciously ripe, almost honeyed, pear fruit emanates from the glass. Underneath that is grapefruit zest and pith and a herbal, stony, earthy edge. The palate is rich and curvaceous but completely toned by a pervasive, lemony acidity that lends drive and linearity. This is already approachable, which is not to say that it doesn't promise a lot of mileage: this will go on and unfold its facets of fruit. Immense charm almost plays over the fact that this is a very age-worthy wine, with a finish that's almost endless. Drink from 2017.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6683,6684,96,Emmerich Knoll 2013 Ried Loibenberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"This is so young, the yeast of the ferment still swings on the nose. Underneath that, tightly curled freshness suggests both candied lemon slices and lemon sorbet—but this needs time to unfurl its glory. Despite its slenderness, this wine has muscle and tone, structure and poise. The long finish is lip-smacking and moreish. Drink 2018–2025.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6684,6685,96,Ramey 2012 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"This longstanding collaboration between vintner and grower reflects years of mutual understanding and respect. The wine offers pretty orange blossom and lemon verbena aromas that wrap around a composed, well-integrated and mineral-laden body. Voluptuous, the wine is also well-balanced, finishing in bright acidity. It is deliciously good.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6685,6686,95,Gramercy 2012 John Lewis Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of top sites Les Collines, SJR and Red Willow. It's perfumed with notes of green olive, violets, dried herbs, mineral and smoked meat. The palate is tightly wound, sensuous and supple, lithe yet rich with tart fruit and savory flavors backed by tannins that need more time to come into their own—but this wine surely deserves it. It has all of the stuffing to be a 20+ year wine. Best from 2025 to 2032. Give it an extended decant if opening in the near term.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
6686,6687,95,Gramercy 2012 Lagniappe Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Blended from Red Willow, Marcoux and Oldfield vineyards, this 100% Syrah offers aromas of green olives, brown stems, dried herbs and raspberries. The palate has densely rich yet exceptionally well balanced fruit and savory flavors that are creamy in feel. It's flat-out stunning, winning on grace and elegance rather than sheer power alone.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
6687,6688,85,Coulson Eldorado 2000 Kipp Vineyard Mataro (El Dorado),"Soft and jammy, with black and red wild berry flavors and low acidity. ItÕs so soft and sweetly fruity itÕs almost like raspberry syrup, although it does have some structure and heat from alcohol. Fans of sweet wines will like it a lot.",Anonymous,
6688,6689,85,Torres 1999 Milmanda Chardonnay (Conca de Barberà),"Though handsomely balanced, this medium-weight Chardonnay shows only modest complexity, with apple, tropical fruit and mild toasty notes on the nose and palate. A slight caramel note gives a vaguely sweet cast to the basically dry fruit flavors. Has appeal and some length, but it's not the statement one would expect at the price. —M.M.",Anonymous,
6689,6690,85,Beringer 1999 Alluvium Blanc White (Knights Valley),"This is a very fruity wine, one dominated by apple and peach and citrus flavors. Good acids make it bright, and it's impeccably clean and focused. Could use some more depth and layers. —S.H.",Anonymous,
6690,6691,85,Hunt Cellars 2000 Outlaw Ridge Zinphony #1 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"The brawniest of Hunt's releases, it borders on Port-like, with 14.7% alcohol and a burst of plummy, raisiny fruit. Other notes include char, smoke and a caramelized, pie-crust scent. Drinks big, slightly sweet, hot and peppery.  —S.H.",Anonymous,
6691,6692,85,Firefall 2000 Lone Meadow Vineyard Rosato di Sangiovese Sangiovese (Fair Play),"From a newish appellation in El Dorado County, this is a copper-colored wine with richly sweet strawberry flavors and a peppery streak that lasts into the finish. It's dry enough for the dinner table. Try with cioppino. —S.H.",Anonymous,
6692,6693,85,Malesan 2000 Rouge  (Bordeaux),"Despite coming from a universally hailed vintage, this generic Bordeaux is still weedy, herbal and lean. But it also has decent cassis and cherry fruit, some tasty vanilla and cinnamon notes from oak aging, and a tart, dry finish. It's light, but it hasn't been dumbed down for the mass market.",Anonymous,
6693,6694,85,Temple Bruer 1998 Cornucopia Grenache (Langhorne Creek),"This round, soft, alcoholic wine deserves praise for its spicy-peppery warmth and abundant cherry fruit. Those same qualities are also its biggest shortcoming: The low acidity and high alcohol make it seem a bit heavy. —J.C",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6694,6695,85,Yalumba 2001 Y Series Riesling (South Australia),"You expected fruity, flowery flavors? A little sweetness? Then go someplace else. This wine is one of the driest of the year, and offers no relief at all from alcohol and other winey compounds. If there's a single, solitary flavor, it's watered down lemon juice. But it might be pretty good with clams on the half shell. —S.H.",Anonymous,
6695,6696,85,El Coto 1998 Crianza  (Rioja),"Smoky oak and dark cherry fruit with herb accents complement each other well in this medium-weight, even red. Leathery hints add complexity, and this tasty, straightforward Rioja never get harsh or astringent. Drink now–2004. —M.M.",Anonymous,
6696,6697,85,Grant Burge 2000 Barossa Vines Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"Packed with grapey, plummy fruit, smoke and vanilla, this is solid entry-level stuff. It's not particularly rich or concentrated, but it is something that's uncommon at this price: balanced. That makes it an attractive by-the-glass option or barbecue companion. —J.C.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6697,6698,85,Kenwood 1998 Massara Merlot (Sonoma Valley),". Unfortunately, 1998 was not 1997, when this bottling was very good. This vintage is less ripe, and so the wine has some green aromas and flavors, in addition to  blackberry. That makes the tannins stick out more. There's nothing to contain them, but if you pair it with the right, rich foods, it will be just fine. —S.H.",Anonymous,
6698,6699,85,Castillo Catadau 1996 Reserva Red (Valencia),"Tasty in a tart way, with licorice hints, this well-balanced, medium-weight red shows plenty of herb-tinged, sour cherry flavor. Good acidity and moderate tannins make this a good match for grilled veal. Think Claret, but from southern Spain. Drink now–2004. Best Buy. —M.M.",Anonymous,
6699,6700,85,Tamás Estates 1999 AVA's: San Francisco Bay/Livermore Valley Zinfandel (California),"Decent everyday sipper, with heaps of sweet berry flavors wrapped in silky bright acids and dusty tannins. It's kind of thin in structure and in the finish, but is a perfectly nice quaff for the price. —S.H.",Anonymous,
6700,6701,85,Beringer 2000 Founders' Estate Chardonnay (California),"User-friendly Chard, all toasty-spicy apples, and peaches and cream. There's almond-skin bitterness in the aftertaste that sort of sets your teeth on edge, but food will take care of that. —S.H.",Anonymous,
6701,6702,85,Montecillo 1998 Crianza  (Rioja),"Angular and tasty, Montecillo's regular offering  is an appealing, uncomplicated ready-to-drink red. Dried fruit, herb and oak flavors meld nicely in this light-medium weight wine best for drinking now through 2004. Best Buy. —M.M.",Anonymous,
6702,6703,85,Ventana 2000 Dry Chenin Blanc (Monterey),"Drinks dry and bitter, with lemony, citrus flavors and an almond-skin tart finish. This is an austere, steely wine of integrity and fine structure. It's a nice palate cleanser, and stimulates the appetite. —S.H.",Anonymous,
6703,6704,84,Morlanda 1998 Crianza Red (Priorat),"Overtly, overwhelmingly oaky, a shot at the international style, this red from the hot region of Priorat just doesn't go anywhere beyond the wood. From stem to stern, the coconut-toasty oak renders all other elements subservient to an extent that grape and location are rendered irrelevant. —M.M.",Anonymous,
6704,6705,89,Sinclair Estate Vineyards 2009 Pentatonic Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The blend is 51% Merlot, the rest divided among five other grapes, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Consequently, it's a bit of a mish-mash, fruity to the point of grapy, medium long, with the barrel flavors unresolved. Give this one another year or two of aging to allow all the components to come together.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6705,6706,89,Steven Kent 2008 Ghielmetti Vineyard Petit Verdot (Livermore Valley),"Dense and meaty like a baked purple leather pouch, this is tightly tannic, with a lift of acidity on the midpalate and a hint of violet struggling to get out. It's an interesting wine; give it 3–5 years in the cellar or drink now with red meat.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6706,6707,89,SuLei 2011 Spring Creek Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"SuLei's Tanya Woodley ferments her Sauvignon Blanc in stainless steel, then ages it in a mix of neutral oak and stainless steel barrels. In this new vintage some residual sugar (just under 1%) remains, to soften the otherwise-searing acidity. It works well, crafting a fleshy wine loaded with citrus and honeydew. The finish lingers and has plenty of lift.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6707,6708,89,Kessler-Haak 2010 Kessler-Haak Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Very much like the fine 2009, the winery's new Chardonnay is bone dry and austere, like a Chablis. Highly minerally, with mouthwatering acidity, the fruit flavors veer toward Meyer lemons and limes.",Anonymous,
6708,6709,89,Cermeño 2009 Tinta de Toro  (Toro),"From a good vintage like 2009, this modest Tinta de Toro has a lot to offer. It smells slightly rustic but full of fruit. The palate has a tannic but balanced feel, with dark, sweet flavors of cassis and blackberry. It's peppery and lightly herbal on the finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6709,6710,89,Ferré I Catasús 2007 CaMerlot Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Penedès),"Dense and somewhat roasted on the bouquet, with tarry, leathery aromas. This feels good but angular, with sheering acidity, firm tannins and solid flavors of red berry, plum, herb and pepper. It's lengthy but a little hot and grabby on the finish. A blend of 50% Cabernet and 50% Merlot.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6710,6711,89,Fidelitas 2008 Optu Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"For the moment, this is rather hard and tight, with notes of black pepper around tangy berry fruit. There are interesting streaks of iron and graphite, and a balanced structure that suggests extended cellaring may be an option. This blend is 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 11% Cabernet Franc and 6% Malbec.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6711,6712,89,Fielding Hills 2009 RiverBend Vineyard Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"A whiff of volatility brightens up the aromas of this ripe Merlot. The structure is tight and compact, and the acidity is substantial. Clean fruit flavors of red and black berries can be found, but this is a year in which all of the Fielding Hills wines would benefit from a bit more bottle age to knit together.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6712,6713,89,Val de Los Frailes 2006 Selección Personal Tempranillo (Cigales),"Roasted and leathery smelling, with aromas of brick dust, root beer and exotic spices. Feels grabby and astringent, with boistrous tannins. It tastes toasty and black, with baked berry flavors and tons of chocolate and spice. It feels a bit choppy on the finish, with an espresso-like aftertaste.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6713,6714,89,Gifford Hirlinger 2009 Estate Petit Verdot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Toasty and firm, this pure Petit Verdot is rich with black cherry and cassis. Whiffs of smoke and a slight burn in the finish suggest that further bottle age will bring in more barrel nuances (from 40% new American oak) and smooth out the finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6714,6715,89,Hermann Moser 2011 Per Due Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"With considerable depth of flavor, this is a rounded, smooth wine. Its green apple flavor is laced with notes of pink grapefruit, crisp pear and a touch of peppered kiwi. It's ready to drink but also worth aging for a few months. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6715,6716,89,M. Chapoutier 2009 Petite Ruche  (Crozes-Hermitage),"An early-maturing Crozes-Hermitage, with aromas of violets and hickory smoke alongside charming blueberry and blackberry fruit. There's not much tannin in this medium-bodied wine, so drink it over the next couple of years for its easy charm.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6716,6717,89,Puelles 2004 Reserva  (Rioja),"This opens with a classic Rioja nose of leather, dried cheese, roast berry and spice. It feels chunky and quite solid, with roasted fruit, tomato and herbal flavors on a deep palate. This is long and a touch warm on the finish, but healthy and ready to drink.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6717,6718,89,Paumanok 2010 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),"Exuberant aromas of white blossoms and ripe stonefruit settle substantially in the glass, revealing a rich yet layered palate that marries sweet cream and butter notes with lemon pith, smoke and striking acidity. Full and opulent, but elegant and balanced. Drink now.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6718,6719,89,Weixelbaum 2010 Alte Reben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"This is a very herbal wine, with a green medicinal edge that contrasts the rich yellow-fruit flavor. There is concentration, dense fruits and a soft, ripe finish. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6719,6720,89,Puelles 2003 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Hailing from the very hot 2003 vintage, this wine is baked and full, with mature yet rich aromas. It feels thorough and weighty, with sweet berry flavors that are at their peak along with a chocolate note. This is warm, full and under control on the finish. Drink now.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6720,6721,89,Sparkman 2009 Kingpin Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"A whiff of leather introduces a wine with a strong savory character; the leather and earth flavors start to bury the sweet berry fruit, and the tannins take on a chalky texture.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6721,6722,89,Domaine de Dionysos 2009 La Cigalette Grenache-Syrah-Mourvèdre-Carignan Cairanne Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),"Made in a traditional style with no evident new oak, leathery, meaty notes balance dusty earth and sour plums on the nose, while the palate is full, round and richly textured. Finishes with dark, savory notes of coffee and black olives. Drink now–2017.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz

6724,6725,80,Renwood 2007 Red Label Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills),"Low in price, high in quantity, low in quality. Dry and tannic with an off taste, the wine doesn't get better with time.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6725,6726,80,Sharabella Wines 2008 Padre Amante Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"Not sure what's going on here but both bottles of this Cab smelled of diesel gasoline, burnt rubber and corn nuts.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6726,6727,80,Campo Marin 2006 Selección Crianza Red (Cariñena),"Sweet red fruit aromas have a chemical artificiality to them. The palate is underdeveloped, thin and tastes medicinal. Drying and hollow on the finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6727,6728,98,Kracher 2008 Zwischen den Seen Nummer 9 Trockenbeerenauslese Welschriesling (Burgenland),"Opulent honey and lemon aromas waft from the glass in this superrich but so balanced wine. The acidity is an essential element, cutting through the sweet orange, honey and ginger flavors. A gorgeous wine.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6728,6729,97,Kracher 2008 Zwischen den Seen Nummer 11 Trockenbeerenauslese Scheurebe (Burgenland),"A beautiful wine that is almost like nectar. It has extreme freshness, while the acidity is a wonderful contrast. Such concentrated orange flavors and a smooth texture while there is a great citrus edge.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6729,6730,97,Castello Banfi 2007 Excelsus Red (Toscana),"The 2007 Excelsus is a gorgeous super Tuscan expression (with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) that shows quality and superior fruit on all levels. Castello Banfi has really hit a home run with this vintage. You'll encounter persuasive aromas of cassis, blackberry, chocolate, tobacco, curry leaf and deep renderings of exotic spice. The wine's texture is exceedingly smooth, rich and long lasting.",Anonymous,
6730,6731,97,Fattoria Petrolo 2008 Galatrona Merlot (Toscana),"Each new vintage of Galatrona proves, year after year, the enormous potential of Italian Merlot. This is a soft and beautifully decadent wine with plush and perfectly ripe aromas of black cherry, light spice, chocolate and tobacco. The smoothness, richness and persistency is simply unbeatable.",Anonymous,
6731,6732,97,Qupé 2006 Bien Nacido Vineyard 25th Anniversary X-Block The Good Nacido Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"A gigantic wine, one of the most powerful Syrahs in memory. Shows fabulously rich tannins from stem fermentation, sweet, spicy and earthy. The aromas and flavors are of mushrooms, grilled meat, blackberries, cherries, cola, black pepper and smoky cedar. Extraordinary depth and complexity, a very great California Syrah. Could soar off the charts in the next 2–3 years.",Anonymous,
6732,6733,96,Shafer 2009 Red Shoulder Ranch Chardonnay (Carneros),"Shafer consistently produces one of the biggest, fruitiest Chardonnays in California, and yet the wine remains balanced and interesting. The 2009 Red Shoulder Ranch is gigantic in pineapples, pears, mangoes, tangerines and honey, yet so minerally and crisp that somehow it finishes dry.",Anonymous,
6733,6734,96,Franz Hirtzberger 2010 Hochrain Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"A beautifully perfumed wine is give shape by its great swathe of minerality, its intense acidity. The fruits range from citrus to white peach, a gallery of delicious flavor. Like any great Riesling, it needs years to mature.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6734,6735,96,Babcock 2009 Microcosm Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"From the southernmost part of the appellation comes this very deeply flavored Pinot Noir. It bursts in the mouth with mushu plum sauce and cherry fruit and the most marvelous feral notes of mushrooms, minerals, hung meat, forest spices and herbs. It's quite a tannic wine, giving it a brooding quality. Huge, massive, stunning. Should glidepath through the next 6–8 years.",Anonymous,
6735,6736,96,Au Bon Climat 2008 20 Years in the Shed with Bob at Bien Nacido Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A stunning Pinot Noir. Feels soft as silk, yet crisp, tastes flamboyant yet controlled, a wine that contains many opposites. Made from a barrel selection of the best of winemaker Clendenen's Bien Nacido Pinots, it's superb to drink now. Hard to exaggerate its charms, with waves of spicy raspberries, cherries, cola and sandalwood. Really seductive and impressive.",Anonymous,
6736,6737,96,Bien Nacido 2007 Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),"From the vineyard's choicest blocks. There's so much going on here, it's hard to know where to begin. Explosive in grilled meats, blackberries, plum jam, licorice, coffee, chocolate, caramel, black pepper and Chinese 5 spice, yet bone dry, with smooth, rich tannins. Extraordinarily good now, and should develop in interesting ways. Certainly one of the best California Syrahs of the last few vintages.",Anonymous,
6737,6738,95,Nicolaysen Family Vineyards 2001 Late Harvest Alisos Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Santa Barbara County),"At nearly 10 years of age, this beautiful Gewürz shows how well a good California dessert wine can age. It's still brisk in clean acidity, but is honeyed and sweet, with nearly 19% residual sugar. Shows rich, exotic pineapple, tangerine marmalade, gingerbread, apricot jam, buttered toast, crème brûlée, vanilla cream and spice flavors, leading to a long, deliriously delicious finish. A heady, flamboyantly sweet wine to drink now.",Anonymous,
6738,6739,95,Kracher 2008 Nouvelle Vague Nummer 8 Trockenbeerenauslese Chardonnay (Burgenland),"When it becomes a sweet wine, Chardonnay's natural richness shows immensely.

6739,6740,95,Poggio al Tesoro 2006 Dedicato a Walter Cabernet Franc (Toscana),"Poggio al Tesoro, located in coastal Tuscany, is showing amazing results with Cabernet Franc.

6741,6742,80,Conquista 2013 Oak Cask Red (Mendoza),"Flat on the nose, then almost identical on the palate, this blend of Malbec, Syrah and Bonarda tastes grassy, lightly green and weedy. Cherry and berry flavors are weak. Tasted twice with similar results.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6742,6743,80,Viejo Isaias 2013 Malbec Rosé (Mendoza),"Sawdust characterizes the nose of this strained rosé. The palate is heavy, resiny and low on acidity, while flavors of forced wood and cream are devoid of fruit.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6743,6744,99,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscadelle (Rutherglen),"This wine is dark brown in hue with a greenish-gold tint to its rim, providing clues to its advanced age. The aromas are nutty, with mossy notes of rancio filled out by sweet flavors of dried dates and figs. It's full bodied and unctuous in texture, without being overblown or heavy on the palate. The intense finish lingers forever—or at least until you give in and take another sip.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6744,6745,98,Pol Roger 2002 Cuvée Sir Winston Churchill Brut  (Champagne),"With its gold color and mature, toasty flavors, this is possibly the greatest Winston Churchill ever. It has weight and richness, with a dense, full and rich texture. It's in perfect balance, bringing together maturity and crisper apple and green plum fruit flavors that are cut with lemon. A mineral edge gives a nervy character that will allow this magnificent wine to age further.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6745,6746,96,Anton Bauer 2012 Reserve Limited Edition Pinot Noir (Wagram),"Earthiness, undergrowth and juicy wild strawberries tinged with wet oak leaf dominate the nose and palate of this exemplary wine.

The finish is complex and nuanced, with lovely earth, spice and fruit sensations.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6746,6747,96,Williams Selyem 2012 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Just beautiful, this wine combines spicy, arresting aromas, vivid, bright cherry and raspberry flavors, an electric mouthfeel and bracing texture. All nerve and muscle, and no fat, it is vibrant in acidity, with firm tannins that support the enticing fruit flavors. Virtually irresistible now, this will gain complexity through at least 2022.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
6747,6748,96,Bründlmayer 2013 Heiligenstein Reserve Lyra Riesling (Kamptal),"Beautifully lifted, almost sublimated apple and citrus fruit combine to make a perfumed, appetizing nose.

Pure and simply very delicious.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6748,6749,96,Williams Selyem 2012 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A perennial standout for good reason, this Pinot is light in color and elusive at first. Teasing in baked strawberry-rhubarb, it subtly offers a rare purity of focused fruit flavor, with gorgeous aromas of dewy rose petals playing a substantial supporting role. Thanks to subtle oak, the finish builds in terms of intensity, with the wine maintaining a delicate balance of minerality.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6749,6750,96,Franz Hirtzberger 2013 Singerriedl Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"A zesty nose promises refreshment and poise. The palate not only keeps this promise but tops it. Orange, mandarin and lemon frame riper peach and Mirabelle plum explode like a firework of fruit on the palate. This is fruit-framed, citrus-focused joy, combining immense concentration with immense elegance. There is a long and exciting life ahead of this.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6750,6751,96,D'Arenberg 2010 The Swinging Malaysian Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"D'Arenberg's lineup of single-vineyard Shirazes is especially impressive in the 2010 vintage, and this was one of my favorites. The aromas are tight, nearly impenetrable at first, then only stubbornly yielding hints of graphite, but the mouthfeel is expansive and richly textured. Aristocratic notes of pencil shavings balance supple tannins and layers of dark fruit, concluding in espresso and chocolate on the finish. Drink now–2030.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6751,6752,95,Krutzler 2012 Perwolff Blaufränkisch (Südburgenland),"Elderberry with edges of tar and smoke, a floral lift and lots of black cherry are the aromatic hallmarks. The palate is muscular but svelte. The structured core of ripe but firm tannin can barely contain the luxuriating, dark elderberry and cherry fruit. This is lovely and crunchy now but will be far better 2017–2018. This is both big and elegant.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6752,6753,95,Alain Brumont 2007 Château Bouscassé Vieilles Vignes Tannat (Madiran),"This is dense, almost impenetrable, a rich wine that is still dominated by dark tannins and black fruits.

6753,6754,95,Deutz 2006 Amour de Deutz Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"With its beautiful rose color and delicate flavors, this continues the elegant tradition of Amour de Deutz.

6754,6755,95,Pichler-Krutzler 2013 Supperin Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Floral notes play above the aromatic woodruff and fig-leaf aromas which make this incredibly enticing. The palate is slender, tight and totally concentrated. This is nervy, high-octane stuff, for now boasting lemon and pink grapefruit, without a single ounce of fat—and yet this is not ungenerous.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6755,6756,95,Prieler 2011 Goldberg Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"Aromatic and spicy fruit speaks here: ripe blueberry and black cherry with brooding insinuations of flower and earth. The customary pepperiness is in attendance, too, but the structured palate bids you to wait. This is firm and focused and for now tightly corseted. Give this until 2017–2019 in bottle for its full beauty and aroma to emerge.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6756,6757,95,Williams Selyem 2012 Eastside Road Neighbors Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Since this is the winery's largest production Pinot, but still under 1,000 cases, buyers actually have a chance of finding this full-bodied beauty. Sly on the nose, it is tense in toasty oak and chewy cherry, venturing into black cherry, blackberry and root beer. It's amply structured and robust, yet with silky tannins. Enjoy through 2022.",Virginie Boone,@vboone

6758,6759,95,Hiedler 2013 Steinhaus Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),"Both ripe red apple and crisp green Granny Smith play on the nose, however, they are laced with both honey and zesty citrus, creating thrill. This is wonderfully poised and invigorating. Totally streamlined and linear, it's a wine to enjoy now and for years to come.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6759,6760,96,Domaine Pinson 2013 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This wine brings out the structure inherent in this vineyard. Tensely textured with young fruits that have a touch of bitterness, the wine offers kiwi and green plum flavors given a more exotic character with some mango. It's a deeply structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6760,6761,95,Joseph Drouhin 2013 Marquis de Laguiche Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"Perfumed and floral, this is a wine with weight and richness.

The wine is for aging; drink from 2019.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6761,6762,95,Ökonomierat Rebholz 2011 Trocken Spätburgunder (Pfalz),"A stunner amidst an increasingly competitive set of German Pinot Noir, this lavishly berried, rich wine is full of nuance and complexity. Deep, ripe black-fruit flavors are accented by rose petals and game. Bristling acidity and taut, grippy tannins lend structure and depth. It drinks beautifully now, but is bound to improve through 2021 and beyond.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6762,6763,95,William Fèvre 2013 Vaudésir Grand Cru  (Chablis),"From vines on the sunny side of the vineyard, this wine is richly textured and structured, full of generous yellow and white fruits, spice and layers of wood aging.

6763,6764,95,Bernhard Huber 2010 Bienenberg R Erste Lage GG Spätburgunder (Baden),"Rose petal and violets persist throughout this complex, deeply nuanced Pinot Noir. The palate is richly berried, but swathed in a musky, earthy perfume that's intoxicating. Bristling acidity and fine, filigreed tannins round out a long finish. Stunning now, but likely to integrate its subtleties further through at least 2025.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6764,6765,95,Blandy's 2002 Colheita Bual (Madeira),"The sweetest of the Madeira single-variety wines, this Bual is still laced with intense acidity.

6765,6766,95,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2013 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This wine has a rich, fat, almost buttery character. Certainly the acidity is there, although it has a warm, summer feel. The structure typical of Les Clos is all there as well, giving concentration and density. At the end spice goes with the extreme freshness of the citrus aftertaste. Drink from 2020.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6766,6767,95,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin 2013 Grenouilles Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This rich, generous and soft wine has a ripe feel along with plenty of acidity.

6767,6768,95,Domaine Laroche 2012 La Réserve de l'Obédience Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This wine, from the Les Clos Grand Cru vineyard, is a flagship for Laroche. It is richer than the producer's regular Les Clos offering, bringing roundness and a fullness to the mineral, textured character. It's open, ripe although it needs aging. Drink from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6768,6769,95,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin 2013 Vaulorent Premier Cru  (Chablis),"This is a very precise wine, steely and mineral.

Drink this wine from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6769,6770,95,Domaine Pinson 2013 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis),"From ripe fruits, in the Pinson style, this is a rich, generous and concentrated wine.

6770,6771,95,Albert Bichot 2011 Domaine Long-Depaquit La Moutonne Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This 2011 is an aristocratic wine, with a mineral character that is now rounding out.

6771,6772,95,Cavallotto 2011 Bricco Boschis  (Barolo),"Dark berry, mint, menthol and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll get on this gorgeous wine.

6772,6773,95,Sandhi 2013 Mt. Carmel Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Lime and apple blossoms, gray slate, wet chalk, a touch of struck match and an ever-so-slight lemon-butter element converge on a wondrous nose in this Rajat Parr-Sashi Moorman winner. Once sipped, the tight citrus hits first, but then come approachable white flowers, golden pears and a touch of ghee and vanilla on the back end.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
6773,6774,95,Joseph Drouhin 2013 Clos de la Garenne Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"This offers toast and spice aromas, with opulent apricots and white peaches along with intense freshness from the acidity and linear structure.

6774,6775,95,Joseph Drouhin 2013 Drouhin-Vaudon Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),"A very mineral, flinty character comes through the powerful texture of this rich, dense wine.

6775,6776,95,Carlisle 2013 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"This substantial wine will age beautifully through 2023, so structured and elegant it is behind its layers and layers of coconut fritter, vanilla and strawberry-raspberry jam. Beguiling in floral violets and lavender, it has streaks of black pepper too, ending in a dream-like trance of earthy dust.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6776,6777,95,Domaine Laroche 2012 Les Blanchots Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This is a textured, steely wine with considerable acidity as much as fruit. Tight and with green apple and green plum characters, this structured wine has a salty, chalky texture. Tasting of the soil, it needs to age. Drink from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6777,6778,95,Rizzi 2011 Pajorè  (Barbaresco),"Underbrush, truffle, ripe red berry, violet and pipe tobacco aromas emerge on this beautiful, structured red.

A generous, gorgeous wine.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6778,6779,95,Sandhi 2013 Bentrock Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"This is one of the most expensive white wines on the Central Coast, and it's mighty good, with aromas of cheese rind, lime pith, slate and tiny bits of Marcona almond and oak smoke.

6779,6780,95,William Fèvre 2013 Valmur Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This is the coolest and freshest of the Grand Cru vineyards.

Drink from 2020.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6780,6781,95,Ziereisen 2010 Blauer Schulen Spätburgunder (Baden),"Another stand out among a lineup of stunning German Pinot Noir, this sultry, sexy wine balances ripe, ruddy black cherry and berry flavors with a vivacious acidic edge.

6781,6782,95,Damilano 2011 Cannubi  (Barolo),"Fragrant blue flower, perfumed berry, leather, cake spice and a balsamic note are some of the scents you'll find on this gorgeous, forward Barolo. The delicious palate offers raspberry, wild cherry, cinnamon, white pepper clove and tobacco. Ripe, polished tannins make this already accessible but it will also age well for a decade or more. Enjoy 2016–2023.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6782,6783,95,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2013 Valmur Grand Cru  (Chablis),"This apple-crisp wine has tight acidity and touches of wood rounded out by yellow fruits.

6783,6784,95,Domaine Laroche 2012 Les Bougerots Grand Cru  (Chablis),"The wine comes from a parcel within the Bougros Grand Cru.

6785,6786,95,Giuseppe Rinaldi 2011 Brunate  (Barolo),"This beautiful wine opens with aromas of ripe dark berry, scorched earth, mint, menthol and a balsamic note. The vibrant palate boasts juicy red cherry, black raspberry, sweet pipe tobacco, baking spice, grilled herb and a hint of game.

6786,6787,95,Albert Bichot 2012 Domaine Long-Depaquit La Moutonne Grand Cru  (Chablis),"While not in the official canon of Grand Crus, La Moutonne is definitely in grand cru territory, a parcel that is divided between Les Preuses and Vaudésir. The 2012 is very structured, dense and textured, with a strongly tannic character packed with minerality. Time will bring out its fruit and richness. Drink from 2019.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6787,6788,89,Force Majeure 2011 Collaboration Series II Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),"This is relatively light for Red Mountain Syrah—silky and tart with accents of orange peel and lemony acidity. The tight, tangy berry fruit shows a streak of chocolate, from time in 30% new French oak, and despite the cool vintage it finishes with some heat.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6788,6789,89,José Maria da Fonseca 2013 Ripanço Private Selection Red (Alentejano),"Using Ripanço, an old technique of destemming the grapes after harvest with wooden rods, the wine has intense color and a smooth, rich character. It is rounded and soft, with a light layer of tannins offering backbone to the generous fruitiness. Drink after 2015.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

6790,6791,89,Meyer Family Vineyards 2012 Reimer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley),"Aromatically appealing in notes of sarsaparilla, barrel spice and cherry.

6791,6792,89,Helfrich 2009 Steinklotz Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This is a honeyed, sweet wine (a fact not indicated on the label). Spice is surrounded by ripe fruits, apricot and lychee, with added pepper. Some citrus acidity comes through at the end. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6792,6793,89,Sparkling Pointe 2011 Brut  (North Fork of Long Island),"A hint of brioche lends autolytic character to fresh spring blossom and lemon notes on this elegant, bristling traditional-method sparkling. It's delicately effervescent and startlingly brisk, finishing on a soft, rolling foam that deliciously lingers.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6793,6794,89,Sparkman 2012 Kindred Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Fruity and dark, this Bordeaux-style blend is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one third a mix of the four other grapes.

6794,6795,89,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2011 JP Private Selection Red (Península de Setúbal),"A 10 month stint in oak has given this rich wine a seriously spicy character supported by dark chocolate and black fruit flavors. Syrah, Castelão and Cabernet Sauvignon give this young wine tannins and a dark texture that needs to soften. Drink after 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6795,6796,89,Blackjack 2012 Black Cap Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"The inviting scents of melting butter on hot dinner rolls and vanilla-lemon custard ensure a rich wine, and the palate delivers with caramelized apples, dominant oak and more vanilla on the finish. It is balanced out with mustardy tartness and lemon rind acidity.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
6796,6797,89,Canoe Ridge 2011 Estate Grown Block 2 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A moderately aromatic wine with notes of melted butter, vanilla, plum, herbs and woodspice. The tannins are firm and tightly wound, needing some time to come together. Best after 2016.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
6797,6798,89,Ca'Romè 2010 Cerretta  (Barolo),"Aromas include rose petal, grilled herb, forest floor, coffee and ripe berry. The palate is still rather closed but offers black cherry, vanilla and espresso alongside astringent tannins that give it an abrupt, drying finish.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6798,6799,89,Charles B. Mitchell 2012 Estate Grand Reserve Red (Fair Play),"Full-bodied and dry, this has a very deep, saturated color and aromas of spicy oak, raspberries and cherries. With velvety texture, fine tannins and a lingering finish, it's well structured and youthful tasting. It should improve through 2017.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
6799,6800,89,Château la Baronnerie 2012 Grand Vin  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"With wood aging, the Sauvignon Blanc has developed vanilla flavors that are currently smothering the fruit. Ginger dominates, along with black pepper, giving a wine that has a tangy texture just hinting at juicy white fruits. Age until 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6800,6801,89,Domenico Clerico 2010 Briccotto  (Barolo),"Not very expressive, this shows subdued aromas that recall coconut, toasted oak, espresso and raw, red berry. The palate delivers red berry, licorice, mocha and vanilla alongside mild tannins. It's already surprisingly accessible. Drink 2015–2020.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6801,6802,89,Elyse 2010 C'Est Si Bon Red (California),"Here is a hearty, full-bodied and dry red blend with a vivid black cherry character and spicy accents like black pepper and fennel. Firm and quite tannic, it will pair nicely with rich meat or cheese dishes that need a little bite in the wine to balance them.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
6802,6803,89,Frank Cornelissen 2012 MunJebel 9 VA Nerello Mascalese (Vino da Tavola),"This is an intense, extreme wine made from Nerello Mascalese vines planted in the 1940s. It's handcrafted, with no selected yeasts or added sulfites, and aged in terra cotta vessels. It's loaded with smoky mineral, concentrated black cherry, black pepper, cinnamon and notes of balsamic herbs framed by solid, velvety tannins. The only criticism is a slight fizzy sensation, but total perfection isn't what this wine is about.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6803,6804,89,Frank Cornelissen 2013 Susucaru Rosato (Vino da Tavola),"Made from both red and white native grapes, this offers an intense fragrance of white and red roses. The floral notes carry over to the palate along with crushed Morello cherry, raspberry jam and candied strawberry. Cracked white pepper and mineral add interest.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6804,6805,89,Fulkerson 2013 William Vigne Zweigelt (Seneca Lake),"While blackberry and cherry notes are lush and ripe on the nose, this Finger Lakes Zweigelt is surprisingly elegant on the palate. Sour cherry and tart plum flavors are concentrated and juicy, but lively in feel. The finish is extended by a fringe of fine, polished tannins.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6805,6806,89,Mercy 2012 Riverbed Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"From this appellation's tremendously rocky soils come aromas of golden pear and buttered toast. The palate is dominated by racy tones of lemon peel and fresh-cut yellow flowers, but rounded out with a slight vanilla buttercream on the finish.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
6806,6807,89,Borges 2011 Reserva Red (Douro),"This is a firmly structured wine, solidly tannic and still developing. Big black-fruit flavors have set their mark on the texture while the dry core brings out the schist soil of the Douro vineyards, giving a tough sensation that needs to soften. Drink from 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6807,6808,88,Il Falchetto 2013 Lurei  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),"Fresh and full-bodied, this offers aromas of black-skinned fruit, underbrush and dark cooking spice. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, plum jam and black pepper alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6808,6809,88,Louis Max 2013 Les Plantenays  (Rully),"This is a steely wine, tight with acidity and lemon fruits. It has a mineral, tangy texture that is still calming down, which suggests a young wine that needs time. Certainly the fruit is all there, if with a nervy character. Drink the wine from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6809,6810,88,Folin Cellars 2014 Estate Viognier (Rogue Valley),"This yellow-gold wine is packed with bright floral and citrus scents and flavors.

6810,6811,88,François Millet 2014 Domaine des Côtes Blanches  (Sancerre),"Still so young, this herbal, fruity wine is as crisp as possible. It is packed with lemon, grapefruit and tight acidity, needing to age. Drink this tense, steely wine from late 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6811,6812,88,Gianfranco Alessandria 2011 San Giovanni  (Barolo),"Aromas of rose, violet, sour cherry and baking spice make a promising initial impression but the palate is on the lean side offering raw red berry, clove, sage and a hint of tobacco. Grainy tannins leave an astringent finish. Let the tannins soften up for another few years and then drink to capture the remaining fruit.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6812,6813,88,Beni di Batasiolo 2011 Sovrana  (Barbera d'Alba),"Aromas of scorched earth, mature black-skinned fruit, blue flower, toast and Oriental spice lead the way on this full-bodied wine.

6813,6814,88,C.H. Berres 2012 Berres Estate Riesling (Mosel),"Punchy and concentrated, this off-dry Riesling juxtaposes plush, peachy fruit against a backdrop of spine-tingling lemon acidity. Its uncomplicated forward style makes it quite quaffable.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6814,6815,88,Cascina Chicco 2014 Gramera Alta  (Barbera d'Alba),"Bright and fragrant, this opens with aromas of underbrush, rose, dark berry and a whiff of exotic spice.

6815,6816,88,Château Bélingard 2012 Réserve Red (Côtes de Bergerac),"This ripe, fruity and structured wine is still young and the tannins need time to round out. However, it is already rich, with juicy red fruits and a core of fragrant acidity. The wine is dense and worth aging. Drink from 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6816,6817,88,Château Bélingard 2013 Réserve White (Bergerac Sec),The chalk subsoil of the Bélingard estate gives this wine its textured character. The wood aging smoothes out the crisp acidity of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon and adds a light layer of toast. It is still a young wine and will be better from late 2016 or even 2017.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
6817,6818,88,Dominio de Tares 2012 Baltos Mencía (Bierzo),Jammy aromas of blackberry and cassis start out gaseous and muddled but find their way with airing. This feels wide and low on zest. Flavors of prune and stewed berry end with toasty oak but also heavy ripe prune and berry flavors. Drink now.,Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6818,6819,88,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2014 Bernkasteler alte Badstube am Doctorberg Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Jolts of honey, lemon and lime introduce this animated Spätlese.

6819,6820,88,El Esteco 2012 Ciclos Icono Malbec-Merlot (Calchaquí Valley),"The nose on this Malbec-Merlot from Salta is raw and saucy, with more brawn and rusticity than elegance. A compact grabby palate is intense, with herbal plum and hefty berry notes that mellow on a chunky lightly herbal finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6820,6821,88,Ellena 2011 Ascheri  (Barolo),"Toast, espresso, coffee bean and dark berry aromas emerge on this firmly structured red. It's still very much on its oak, showing unripe sour cherry backed up by oak-driven spice including vanilla and coconut alongside grippy tannins.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6821,6822,88,Jean Milan NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"Crisp and fresh, this has an attractive tight texture that contrasts with the red berry fruits and lively acidity. It's a real apéritif style of wine, light and fruity.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6822,6823,88,José Maria da Fonseca 2012 José de Sousa Red (Alentejano),"This is an open juicy and fruity wine.

6823,6824,88,Lelarge-Pugeot NV Premier Cru Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Champagne),"Fresh, ripe and fruity, this is a rich wine, produced from vines to the west of Reims.

6824,6825,88,Lobo 2012 Wulff Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"From 100% estate-grown fruit, this 100% varietal wine is dusty and dark with elements of pencil shavings, cedar and cassis. With that herbal and earthy intensity giving it defined character, it remains medium bodied and textured on the palate, with a saltiness to the finish.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6825,6826,88,Longboard 2013 DaKine Vineyard Merlot (Russian River Valley),"From the producer's estate vineyard, the grapes planted on budwood from Napa Valley's famous Three Palms, this wine is bittersweet in tannin and flavor, a mix of blueberry, cedar, resin and clove. Full bodied in style, it maintains an elegance on the finish, marked irresistibly in dark chocolate.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6826,6827,88,Magnum Vinhos 2013 Tom de Baton Branco White (Douro),"From a high-altitude vineyard in the heart of the Douro, this is a fruity while well textured wine. With a strong mineral character that comes from the lees stirring during fermentation, it has both bright citrus fruits with acidity and a more tropical character. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6827,6828,88,Martin Ray 2014 Dutton Ranch George Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"This wine shows perfumed lychee on the nose, before weightier tones of melon, lemon and oak enter the picture, providing a richness of body and power. The oak and a sprinkling of nutmeg remain firm and focused on the finish.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6828,6829,88,Mounts 2012 Estate Grown Grenache (Dry Creek Valley),"Cherry-vanilla surrounds a flank of big oak, while classic notes of baked strawberry also come into play. A brawny, full-bodied expression of the variety, given 6% Mourvèdre and 6% Syrah, it has good bones and acidity lurking beneath the power.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6829,6830,88,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils 2008 Cuvée Paradoxe Premier Cru  (Champagne),"This is a blend from Aÿ on the Montagne de Reims and from the Côte des Blancs. It is intensely perfumed, with weight from Pinot Noir and crispness from Chardonnay. If it seems not quite integrated at this stage, it will hopefully come together over the next few years to reveal a ripe and rich wine. Drink from 2017.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6830,6831,88,Roco 2013 Gravel Road Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tight and tart, this entry-level bottling marries sharp fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry to a high-acid foundation. It's fruit-forward, perfect to gulp down with a favorite sandwich or football food.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6831,6832,88,Roco 2013 The Stalker Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This new cuvée takes its name from the fermentation practice of mixing whole berries with grape-cluster stalks—just stalks, not whole clusters. Herbs and pine needle flavors dominate brambly berry fruit. It's quite young and raw, and will benefit from further bottle age.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6832,6833,88,Rutini 2014 Encuentro Chardonnay (Mendoza),"This is nice and hints at greater things, but ultimately it's more modest and fluffy than substantive. Aromas of oak resin, baked apple and vanilla introduce a palate with mild acidity and not much structure. Vanilla, caramel, banana and honey- dew flavors finish soft.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6833,6834,80,Vivencias 2008 V Tempranillo (Vino de Calidad de Valtiendas),"This is not fresh or fruity; in fact, the nose is nutty and muddied, with a rough, angular mouthfeel and flavors of peanut, vanilla and leathery raspberry.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6834,6835,80,Bodegas Corellanas 2011 Viña Rubican Rosé (Navarra),"This has already past its sell-by date. The color is tan and maderized, while the nose is soft and mushy, with raisiny aromas.

Well integrated, it's a standout among standouts.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6836,6837,95,Bonaccorsi 2010 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Shows the ripe voluptuousness that this vineyard always brings to Pinot Noir, as well as near-perfect balance. So rich, so delicious, it's hard not to drink the whole bottle. Waves of raspberry and cherry preserves, date-nut bread, white pepper, brown sugar, vanilla and toast are wrapped in a silky texture, with gorgeous acidity and smooth tannins. Drink over the next six years.",Anonymous,
6837,6838,95,Black Kite 2010 River Turn Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Wow. Black Kite's River Turn, one of of its three annual block designates, is invigoratingly inviting, a heady mix of floral cherry pie, bright, full and ripe with a balanced backbone of acidity and a gentle hint of gingerbread. This wine is ready to enjoy this second, but if you can help yourself, it'll also hold up for several years in the cellar and no matter when you decide to drink it, pair exquisitely with a range of deftly mannered food.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6838,6839,94,Bonaccorsi 2010 Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Astonishingly deep in flavor, offering an explosion of the ripest cherries and raspberries imaginable. Additional notes of toasty oak, brown sugar and cinnamon spice make this Pinot irresistible, while the acidity brings all the richness to life. Drink now–2016.",Anonymous,
6839,6840,94,Côte Bonneville 2006 DuBrul Vineyard Côte Bonneville Red (Yakima Valley),"This is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one-third Merlot, all sourced from the estate's DuBrul vineyard. It's drinking quite well, though clearly heading into secondary fruit flavors that reflect its ongoing maturation. Cherries, plums and cassis fruits mingle, along with silky, polished tannins. Though it can be cellared indefinitely, it may be at its most delicious drinking peak currently.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6840,6841,94,Sean Thackrey 2010 Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Ethereally light with delicate red cherry flavor, this Pinot is soft, complex and interesting, with a racy herbal streak lurking in the background. Think a ham-and-cheese quiche gingerly sprinkled with thyme and oregano. So distinctive, one wonders what grows near this particular set of vines on the Wentzel Vineyard.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6841,6842,94,Monteviejo 2008 Lindaflor La Violeta Malbec (Mendoza),"Much like the previous vintage of La Violeta, this is a fabulous Malbec with depth, density and power to spare. The bouquet yields marzipan, cola, fine leather, char and rich berry aromas. That sets up a palate with impeccable structure and huge flavors of beef jerky, mocha, black fruits and spice. The finish is massive and loaded, with licorice and mocha flavors. Drink now–2018. Only 100 cases made, with 50 imported into the U.S.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6842,6843,94,Dyer 2008 Dyer Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"So rich, ripe and succulent, you can hardly keep from drinking it now. But don't. This is one for the cellar. The alcohol is a refreshingly balanced. The wine is already throwing some sediment, and more than four years of bottle age are mellowing the wine's edges, with the primary blackberry and cherry flavors developing secondary characteristics. Should begin to peak around 2016 and drink well for another decade.",Anonymous,
6843,6844,94,Gravner 2005 Amfora Ribolla Gialla (Venezia Giulia),"Amfora's copper-ornage color is completely unique in the wide world of contemporary wine. There's a luminous brightness to the wine's appearance that defies its many years of age. Matured in clay amphorae, this pure expression of Ribolla Gialla delivers a softer approach than Gravner's Breg (a white blend) and amazingly intense aromas of resin, pine nut, caramel, graham cracker and candied fruit. Firm structure and determined flavors mark the long close. You can drink it now or hold 10 more years.",Anonymous,
6844,6845,94,Siduri 2011 Keefer Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The pedigree of this vineyard shows in every aspect. It's not just the ripe black cherry and pomegranate fruit, or the brisk acidity, or the lush, gorgeous tannin structure. It's the incredible complexity, showing all kinds of mushroom,  cola, smoked meat and spice notes. Simply gorgeous now, and should develop over the next 10 years.",Anonymous,
6845,6846,94,Bonaccorsi 2010 Cargasacchi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Making Pinot Noir this sensually delicious is only half the effort. The challenge is to provide balance. Winemaker Jenne Lee Bonaccorsi succeeds wildly with this wine. The vineyard is planted entirely with the Dijon clone 115, and the wine shows the purest raspberry and cherry fruit—focused and intense. Yet there are all sorts of earthy, mushroomy, oaky complexities. Gorgeous now, and will hold for at least six years.",Anonymous,
6846,6847,94,Carol Shelton 2009 Showket Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"An absolutely delicious Cabernet, with ripe blackberry, black currant, milk chocolate and spicy oak flavors. Beyond the richness is a superb structure of gorgeously refined tannins and just enough acidity to give balance. So easy to drink, so elegant, you could drain the bottle tonight. But it will age effortlessly through 2018.",Anonymous,
6847,6848,94,Château Lagrézette 2009 Le Pigeonnier Malbec (Cahors),"A small vineyard of six acres is used to produce this magnificent incarnation of Malbec. Black as ink and firmly tannic, a toughness magnified by new wood, this is still a richly fruity wine that will age superbly to give power and complexity. Keep for at least four years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6848,6849,94,Black Kite 2010 Stony Terrace Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"More subtle at first than the 2010 River Turn, Stony Terrace, another of Black Kite's yearly single-block designates, is earthy, savory and dense. Mouth filling in its juicy red and blue fruit flavor, it's silky and entirely seductive. Well integrated and structured, it's another fine choice for the table and for cellaring another 5–7 years.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6849,6850,94,Terra Valentine 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Exceptionally ripe, concentrated mountain fruit as well as hard tannins characterize this fresh, young Cabernet. Through the tannic astringency, intense flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and the sweet sap of oak shine through. Needs time. Hold until 2016 and see how it's doing.",Anonymous,
6850,6851,94,V. Sattui 2009 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"V. Sattui has quietly been producing outstanding Cabernets, and here's another. The vineyard is on the Rutherford bench, arguably the tenderloin of the appellation. Made from 100% Cabernet, the wine is sumptuously rich and soft in tannins, with sour red-cherry candy, licorice, bacon and pepper spice flavors. Will age well for at least 10 years.",Anonymous,
6851,6852,93,Avennia 2010 Gravura Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The name pays homage to the Graves region of Bordeaux, and the blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Franc also mimics those wines. Here the grapes are sourced from the Red Willow (Yakima Valley), Bacchus (Columbia Basin) and Klipsun (Red Mountain) vineyards. Supple, with beautifully integrated red fruits, and tannins as soft as a kiss, it's masterful winemaking from Chris Peterson, who tended the wines of DeLille for many years.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6852,6853,93,Cobblestone 2009 Cobblestone Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"An impressive Cabernet, rich and dense in fruit and oak, with tremendous tannins that are at once hard and soft. It's already throwing some sediment, and the cherry and raspberry fruit comes through in a pure, sweetly feminine manner. Should continue to evolve in the bottle for at least 10 years.",Anonymous,
6853,6854,93,Tapiz 2008 Black Tears Malbec (Mendoza),"Until now, Tapiz has been a value-driven brand with no wine priced above $20. This outstanding Malbec shows that they've been holding something back. Black Tears is ripe and handsome, with almost everything in its perfect place. It's a hard-driving wine with blackberry, vanilla and coconut aromas and flavors in front of a chewy, tannin-rich finish with the mildest note of raisin. Drink this unbridled stud now through 2017.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6854,6855,93,Donum 2010 East Slope Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Here's a complex young wine, vastly ripe and expressive, yet with the balance to age. Marked by a squeeze of citrusy acidity, it's rich in cherry pie flavors that are wrapped into softly firm tannins. There's a touch of beetroot that gives it an earthy complexity. A very interesting example of Carneros that should improve for 5–6 years, if not longer.",Anonymous,
6855,6856,93,Easton 2010 Estate Bottled Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Edgy with mountainous berry flavor, Easton's 2010 Shenandoah Valley Zin is full-bodied, generous in savory spices and blackberry flavor and intoxicatingly aromatic with a peppery, leathery finish. It's structurally able to withstand many more years in bottle, so enjoy it now or give it some time. Either way, it'll shine poured alongside peppery meat.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
6856,6857,93,Gravner 2005 Anfora Breg White (Venezia Giulia),"Gravner's Breg (Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Riesling Italico) shows Sauternes-like aromas of honey, candied apricot, butterscotch, caramel and almond paste. The wine delivers a pretty orange color with copper highlights (it is famously aged in clay amphorae) with firm but velvety rich tannins. The finish is long and smooth and there's a very beautiful touch of drying mineral on the close. Hold five more years at least.",Anonymous,
6857,6858,93,Bernard Baudry 2010 Le Clos Guillot  (Chinon),"A chalk soil vineyard gives this very mineral interpretation of Loire Cabernet Franc. It has richness, weight, solid, ageworthy tannins as well as juicy red fruits. Dried fruits and just a hint of herbal acidity add complexity to a wine that is still young. Age for 5–6 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6858,6859,93,Bernard Baudry 2010 Les Grézeaux  (Chinon),"From clay and silex soil at the foot of the hill behind the Baudry house, this solid, richly fruity wine brings out both concentrated tannins and opulent, red berry flavors. Showing the great potential structure from old vines, this is a wine for aging over at least six years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6859,6860,93,Bonaccorsi 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A terrific Pinot, wonderful for drinking now, and should develop some bottle complexity over the next 5–6 years. Really shows off that flashy Bien Nacido character, offering wildly rich cherry and persimmon flavors, balanced with brisk acidity and a dusting of fuzzy tannins.",Anonymous,
6860,6861,93,Seghesio 2010 Cortina Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"As always, Seghesio's Cortina is a rich, complex Zinfandel. It captures Zin's briary, brambly, spicy personality, with dense, wild forest-berry fruit, yet manages to be elegantly compact and even Cabernet-like in its tannin structure. A very classy wine that deserves a spot on the best wine lists.",Anonymous,
6861,6862,85,Casal do Conde 2011 Reserva Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo),Burned wood aromas reveal the smoky nature of this wine. Wood aging and a bitter chocolate character dominate. There is a question as to whether it can soften. Wait until 2017 at least.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
6862,6863,85,Cerro Prieto 2009 La Teresa Bloc Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Chocolate milk, with a squeeze of cassis liqueur and the sweet vanillins of toasted oak, are the flavors. With the high alcohol, it's almost a dessert wine. Give it credit for a heady opulence.",Anonymous,
6863,6864,85,Château de Pizay 2012 Château de Saint Lager  (Brouilly),"A typically light Brouilly that is fresh, full of cherry acidity and soft tannins. It has a juicy element, lightly herbal and with stalky, tight fruit at the end. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6864,6865,85,Château Thuron 2005 Tradition  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"Dry and tannic, this totally structured wine has weight. However the fruit element has vanished leaving a dense wine, very firm and just given brightness by acidity. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6865,6866,85,Collier Falls 2011 Hillside Estate Primitivo (Dry Creek Valley),"A bit rustic in style, it's got black currant, raisin and tobacco flavors and lots of peppery spiciness, and the finish is thoroughly dry. But there's a brusqueness to the tannins that makes it feel rough and edgy in the mouth.",Anonymous,
6866,6867,85,Corte Moschina 2012 Roncathe  (Soave),"The closed nose gives away very little, just the barest whiffs of yellow flowers. The one-dimensional palate offers fleeting sensations of tart apple and hints of green melon and lemon zest.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6867,6868,85,Derey Frères 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Fixin),"Light tannins accompany crisp red fruits. What it lacks in weight and complexity, it makes up for with a smooth texture, good acidity and a structure that will allow it age for another year.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6868,6869,85,Hill Wine Company 2012 Black Dog Series Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"Pleasantly crisp raspberry, cola and oak flavors mark this easy to drink Pinot Noir. It has a good burst of acidity for balance, and feels silky in the mouth. Drink up.",Anonymous,
6869,6870,85,Jean-Luc Baldès 2013 Clos Triguedina Le Rosé du Clos Rosé (Vin de Pays du Comté Tolosan),"Because Cahors is an appellation only for red wine, this rosé from the Clos Triguedina vineyard is a more lowly Vin de Pays. It's fruity, showing Malbec acidity rather than tannins and some attractive berry fruits. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6870,6871,85,L. Tramier & Fils 2012 La Minée  (Bourgogne),"While the aromas have rustic overtones, the wine itself goes down the red fruit path. It shows juicy cherry flavors, soft but present tannins and a good touch of spice and wood. There is an attractive smoky aftertaste. Drink in 2015.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6871,6872,85,L. Tramier & Fils 2012 Tiserny  (Bourgogne),"A fresh and fruity wine, it's full of light and attractive peach and apple flavors. The wine has fresh acidity and a soft texture that is opening well. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6872,6873,85,Loacker 2012 Atagis Gewürztraminer (Mitterberg),"This steely white offers up very little aromas. The palate delivers lip-pursing sour lemon alongside vibrant acidity, giving this a hard, lean quality.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6873,6874,85,Case Paolin 2009 S. Carlo Red (Montello e Colli Asolani),"This blend from northern Italy opens with aromas of currants, black berries and bell pepper.

6874,6875,85,Castel Sallegg 2012 Pulvernai Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),This simple Pinot Grigio has aromas of pears and yellow spring flowers.

6875,6876,85,Cave de Lugny 2012 Les Charmes  (Mâcon-Lugny),"This is the freshest apple and citrus-driven wine. It has great fruitiness allied to acidity and a soft, creamy structure. Drink in 2014.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6876,6877,85,Wetzel Estate 2010 Cellar Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Beet root and cherry flavors mixed with some barnyard scents lead into a modestly ripe wine with strong herbal components. The finish takes a turn into bitterness.,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6877,6878,85,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Samora Tinto Red (Tejo),"Full and round, this is a ripe blackberry-flavored wine. It has a touch of licorice, followed by juicy fruitiness and some acidity. The aftertaste, with its flavors of wood aging, suggests it could mature through 2015.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6878,6879,85,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Dona Helena Colheita White (Península de Setúbal),"This is a fine, simple wine for this summer. With acidity, fresh apple and pear flavors, it's attractive and aromatic.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6879,6880,85,Collier Falls 2011 Hillside Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A big, lusty Zin, it shows the tendency to overripeness that can mar the variety. While it's dry, it's rich in raisins and prunes, with a good tannin-acid structure that wants barbecued meat to play with.",Anonymous,
6880,6881,85,Domaine D'en Ségur 2013 Le Rosé (Côtes du Tarn),"Cabernet and Syrah are an unusual blend for a rosé, but this fresh and crisp wine works well. It has a vivid pink color followed by equally vivid red fruits and refreshing final acidity. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6881,6882,87,Vieil Armand 2009 Château Ollwiller Pinot Noir (Alsace),"Light in color, this is a soft, red fruited wine. It has red cherry flavors with a dry edge of fruit tannin and wood. The acidity and the juicy aftertaste give a really attractive finish.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6882,6883,87,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 Fuller Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This bottling was supervised by retired Tualatin founder Bill Fuller. It saw 80% new oak, and barrel flavors dominate the palate. Big bursts of vanilla and tobacco somewhat mask the light cherry fruit, giving the impression that the wine is a little out of balance.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6883,6884,87,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 Tualatin Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"These old vines produce a powerful wine, that retains strong flavors of stem and earth despite the extra ripeness in 2012. The red berry fruit slides into suggestions of tomato juice.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6884,6885,87,Trinity Hill 2011 The Trinity Red (Hawke's Bay),"Although this includes small amounts of Tempranillo, Malbec and Petit Verdot, this is basically a traditional Bordeaux-style blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. It's fruit forward and approachable even now, with ample fruit flavors of black cherries and cassis. Drink now–2018.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6885,6886,87,Cline 2012 Live Oak Vineyards Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"This has bright raspberry and almost-sweet blackberry flavors, full body, moderate tannins and a long warm finish. It tastes polished, soft and satiny smooth.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
6886,6887,87,Cubanisimo Vineyards 2011 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Much like its companion Rumba Pinot, this is light and tart, with sour cherry fruit.

6887,6888,87,Domaine Charles Frey 2010 Plaisir Perlant Millesimé Extra Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Strong, attractive apple aromas also give the flavor profile of this fresh and fruity wine.

6888,6889,87,Domaine Léon Boesch 2013 Le Coq Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This dry style of Pinot Gris brings out a strong acidity as well as ripe fruitiness.

6889,6890,87,Dr. Nägler 2013 Rüdesheimer Berg Rottland Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),"There's nothing flashy about this dry, delicately framed Riesling. It's quietly elegant, focused on pristine lemon and lime flavors, along with bitter citrus pith on the finish.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,

6894,6895,87,Peter Nicolay 2013 Ürziger Goldwingert Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Touches of caramel and apple cider offset intense lemon acidity in this medium-dry spätlese. It's refreshingly juicy, with a reverberating citrus-rind finish.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6895,6896,87,Chatham 2012 Church Creek Steel Chardonnay (Virginia's Eastern Shore),"Lemon curd and citrus blossom ride over underripe melon and apple on the nose.

6897,6898,87,Domaine Carneros 2012 Pinot Clair Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A white Pinot Noir made from estate-grown grapes, this is a curious wine and perhaps an acquired taste, though it has found its fans via the winery.

6898,6899,87,Domaine Schoffit 2012 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This big, ripe wine is opulent and smooth.

6899,6900,87,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2013 Dry Riesling (Mosel),"Bracing tones of lime and lemon accentuate the crush of mineral tones throughout this dry, revitalizing wine.

6925,6926,88,Quinta Vale Dona Maria 2014 Vintage  (Port),"This Port comes from a good year for single-quinta vintages. Made in open stone lagars, it is a ripe, black-fruited wine, packed with sweet plums as well as raisins and figs. At this stage, the added brandy is very prominent and the wine needs time. It should be ready to drink for its fruit by 2018, for its maturity by 2026.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

Light wood aging has smoothed some of the fruit tannins and added spice. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6928,6929,88,Alfred Gratien NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"In this subtle wine, red fruits are cut with a shot of acidity and a tight texture. A hint of toast perhaps comes from the wood used in the first fermentation but also from the bottle age. The wine is ripe, full and ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6929,6930,88,Caves Transmontanas 2006 Vértice Bruto Pinot Noir (Douro),"Disgorged in 2014, this pale rosé wine definitely has bottle age.

6932,6933,88,Chehalem 2014 Corral Creek Vineyards Riesling (Chehalem Mountains),"Just a touch of residual sugar (11 g/L) softens up the edges of this wine, which brings flavors of tart lemon, grapefruit pith and wet paper into play. Try it with prawns, shellfish or non-spicy noodle dishes.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6933,6934,88,Chehalem 2015 INOX Unoaked Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Done entirely in stainless tanks, this fruity wine offers spring fresh flavors of citrus, pineapple and green melon.

6938,6939,88,Domaine Charles Frey 2014 Nature Extra Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Something of both fresh and dried pink grapefruit zest plays about the nose. The very frothy palate adds some spice to that, as well as a pleasant hint of bitterness. All the fruit is accentuated by the frothing bursting bubbles. Drink soon, ideally as an animating apéritif. The zesty finish is very appetizing.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6939,6940,88,Domaine Les Carmels 2014 Les Vendanges  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),"This is an attractive, ripe and fruity wine made from Merlot and Cabernet Franc vines.

6941,6942,85,Rio Madre 2013 Graciano Rosé (Rioja),"Cherry, raspberry and candied aromas announce a plump but bland palate with sweet, candied flavors of red fruits. These turn slightly harsh before finishing with good feel and controlled bitterness.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6942,6943,85,Robert Karcher et Fils 2013 Harth Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This soft, medium-dry wine has attractive spice and fresh yellow-fruit flavors. It is bright, feeling light with its poised acidity and crisp aftertaste.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6943,6944,85,Tzuba 2010 Metzuda Syrah (Judean Hills),"This deep ruby-colored wine has a bouquet of black cherry with hints of smoked meat and red bell pepper. Flavors of smoked meat and cherry pie with notes of orange peel never completely coalesce. There are some pleasant moments on the palate, but they don't all come together at the same time.",Mike DeSimone,@worldwineguys
6944,6945,85,Wildewood 2013 Hirschy Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Diffuse and herbal, this has a slightly rustic bent, with overall herbaceousness. It smoothes out through the finish, though generally it just seems thin and under-ripe.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6945,6946,85,Bodegas Carballal 2013 Cepas Vellas Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Vanilla, lees notes and wafer cookie aromas are not terribly fruity or upright. This is chunky on the palate, with an odd spritzy feel. Briny orange is the key flavor, along with an oily nuttiness.The finish is pithy and breaks up.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6946,6947,85,Chatham 2013 Church Creek Vintner's Blend Red (Virginia's Eastern Shore),"Menthol and pepper ride over dark cherry and spicy plum aromas.

6947,6948,85,Domaine Charles Frey 2013 Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace),"Young and fruity, this is a soft, citrus and apple flavored wine. Attractive acidity is enhanced by the light minerality and tangy aftertaste. Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6948,6949,85,Feudi del Pisciotto 2012 Carolina Marengo Frappato (Sicilia),"Aromas of toasted oak and lemon zest carry through to the one-dimensional, lean palate, along with confectionary notes.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe
6949,6950,85,Bodegas Ateca 2013 Honoro Vera Verdejo (Rueda),"Pithy citrus, radiator dust and grassy aromas are basic. A simple, plump palate is showing signs of flattening, while leesy, creamy flavors of pear and melon finish similarly. Drink immediately.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6950,6951,85,Bougetz 2012 The Cairn Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Sourced from the Volamus Vineyard and aged in half new French oak, this has a leathery component. Tannic and big-boned, it's more savory than fruity, with a streak of mint lurking in the background.",Virginie Boone,@vboone

6953,6954,85,Sevtap 2013 Bosphorus Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"The nose is a bit curious, with hard vanilla, smoked melon and grilled citrus.

6958,6959,89,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac 2012 Prieuré de Cénac Mission Malbec (Cahors),Black fruits and dry tannins are coming together well in this second wine of Château Saint-Didier Parnac.

6959,6960,89,Comartin 2013 Stone Row Zabala VIneyard Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco),"Yellow pear skin, crushed pine needles and white rocks bolster traditional cat-pee aromas on this wine from the ancient river stone-laden Arroyo Seco appellation.

6960,6961,89,Domaine de Gensac 2012 Piaffer Red (Gers),"A blend that includes Syrah and Tannat as well as Bordeaux grapes, this is a wood-aged, ripe and rich wine.

6961,6962,89,Domaine Maby 2013 La Fermade White (Lirac),"Perhaps it is the large Clairette component (52%), but this blend finishes with an attractive tingle of lime that brightens the whole experience. Honeyed melon and traces of raw almond give the impression of softness, yet the wine remains refreshing. The balance is 26% Grenache Blanc, 13% Viognier and 9% Picpoul.

6962,6963,89,Domaine Rolet Père et Fils NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant de Jura),"With light flavors of ripe red fruits balanced by fresh acidity, this rosé sparkler is full in the mouth and deliciously fruity. A lively mousse gives lift to the fresh aftertaste.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6963,6964,89,Gordon Estate 2011 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Here's a solid effort from a challenging (cool) vintage.

6965,6966,89,Hafner 2008 Old Vienna Composition Ice Wine Eiswein Grand Cuvée Red (Burgenland),"A mildly oxidative streak adds an extra dimension to the rich dried fruit notes that are heady with Medjool dates, raisins and figs, cut though with the sharpness of orange zest. Molasses and dark muscovado sugar appear in the background and virtually beg for slices of gingerbread and fruitcake.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino
6966,6967,88,Villa Le Prata 2012 Tirso  (Rosso di Montalcino),"Underbrush, leather, black pepper, clove and leather lead the nose on this brawny wine.

6967,6968,88,Alexandria Nicole 2011 Quarry Butte Destiny Ridge Vineyard Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A Cabernet Sauvignon-leaning Bordeaux-style blend, this has a healthy dash of Syrah (10%) added to the mix. It brings notes of jammy red fruit (cherry, raspberry) and herbs along with an assortment of barrel spice top notes, with tart flavors and somewhat unresolved tannins.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
6968,6969,88,Alta Alella 2010 Mirgin Sparkling (Cava),"This mature brut nature is smoky and stalky/bitter on the nose. In the mouth, it's lean and acidic, with little body in support of citrus and gritty apple flavors. Bitterness and white-pepper notes rise up on the finish. For razor-sharp Cava, this fits the bill.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6969,6970,88,Anthony Nappa 2013 Frizzante Sparkling (New York),"Frizzante is the perfect term to describe this nervy, invigorating sparkling wine made from an unusual blend of Pinot Noir, Riesling and Gewürztraminer.

6970,6971,88,Bedell 2013 Sparkling Rosé Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),"Whiffs of exotic spice lend flair to berry and cherry aromas on this sparkling blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Exuberantly pétillant, it's fresh with cranberry  acidity and tart red-plum and cherry flavors.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6971,6972,88,Bindella 2012 Fossolupaio  (Rosso di Montepulciano),"Floral and fragrant, this lively Rosso offers blue flower, leather and perfumed berry aromas over crunchy dark cherry, vanilla and cinnamon flavors.

6972,6973,88,Canoe Ridge 2011 Reserve Cherry Street Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"There's much to enjoy in this unusual blend of Syrah, Merlot, Grenache, Cabernet Franc and Pinot Noir.

The flavors are tart, tangy and precise, with chewy tannins providing the frame.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
6973,6974,88,Treleaven 2011 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Cayuga Lake),"Violets mingle with notes of dark char and almond on this perfumed, nuanced Cabernet Franc. On the palate, delicate sour-cherry flavor flavors are subdued by swathes of earth and spice. Brisk in acidity, it finishes with a mouthful of penetrating but finely textured tannins.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
6974,6975,88,Columbia Crest 2011 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This very limited reserve is from a particular block, and as with most block selections, it offers focused, somewhat constrained flavors. Precisely defined red berry fruit is set in a frame of vanilla, toast and coffee. It's a pleasant, albeit generic quaffer.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6975,6976,88,Ironstone 2013 Obsession Symphony (California),"Honey is the key word to describe the nose and flavor of this extremely aromatic and just slightly sweet wine, which also offers notes of honeysuckle and honeydew. Winemakers often turn the grape Symphony (a cross of Muscat of Alexandria and Grenache Gris) into a sweet, dessert-style wine, but this shows how good it can be in a drier version.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
6976,6977,88,J. Bookwalter 2011 Foreshadow Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Syrah, with a core of blueberry and cocoa. It's super-smooth and quite easy to sip and enjoy. But apart from that, and the seductive coffee/mocha flavors that run rampant through the finish, it shows little of the depth and complexity that Washington Cabernet can display. Drink 2017–2019.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6977,6978,88,Kontos 2013 Gossamer White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lively and full-bodied, the blend includes Chardonnay, Marsanne, Roussanne and Pinot Gris.

Medium weight, with a very attractive sweet spice and charred egg-bread accented finish.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
6979,6980,89,Alente 2009 Trincadeira-Aragonez Red (Alentejo),"An elegant wine that slides easily over the palate. Its red berry flavors have a firm edge that stiffens the initial softness. Its tannins and acidity make this a serious, food-friendly wine that could age.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6980,6981,89,Ansgar Clüsserath 2010 Steinreich Trocken Riesling (Mosel),"Perhaps because of its slow, natural fermentation in large casks and the resulting lees contact, this wine shows a bit of toasty, mealy character and a slightly creamy texture. It's a weighty Riesling (for the Mosel, anyway), with ripe notes of peach complementing citrus fruit and a dry, stony finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6981,6982,89,Casas del Toqui 2010 Terroir Selection Gran Reserva Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Piercing on the nose, with aromas of cola, graphite, juniper and blackberry. Feels thick, with meaty flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, herb and flower notes. Layered and relatively long on the finish. Impressive for under-$20 Chilean Syrah, with complexity and sauvage notes.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6982,6983,89,Château du Cayrou 2009 No 46 Malbec (Cahors),"With its wood aging, the ripe and concentrated Malbec adds an extra dryness to the rich flavor of black plums. The wine is dense, balanced with toast. It could be aged, but is ready to drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6983,6984,89,Domaine le Bout du Lieu 2007 Empyrée Malbec (Cahors),"A wood-dominated wine that is powerfully extracted. It is dense, with a bitter coffee character, followed by some juicy blackberry flavors. It is still all bare bones, very firm and dry.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6984,6985,89,Kudos 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir,"This has the classic flavors of many Oregon Pinot Noirs, a balanced mix of tangy red fruits, mineral, earth and more than a hint of stem. It's full bodied and detailed, with excellent balance, weaving threads of site and grape into a complex finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6985,6986,89,Leone de Castris 2007 50th Vintage Riserva Red (Salice Salentino),"Salice Salentino is a historic Italian red wine made with a blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera. This interpretation shows off sun-ripened aromas of prune, raisin and cherry liqueur. The mouthfeel is plush and chewy, but also marked by a firm tannic backbone and lingering cinnamon and nutmeg.",Anonymous,
6986,6987,89,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2010 Villa la Réserve Malbec (Vin de France),"Although this is labeled Vin de France, this is effectively a Cahors wine. It's soft and rounded, with tannins that are already integrated already into blackberry jam flavors. Rich, with a hint of dried fruit, this is ready to drink in a year.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6987,6988,89,Panther Creek 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A bit reduced when first opened, it throws off scents of burnt rubber, then slowly opens into a roundly fruity, lightly toasty Pinot with a firmly tannic base. Flavors of Dr. Pepper drift through the midpalate. Give it a good decanting and it's fine for near-term consumption.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6988,6989,89,Quinta de Sant'Ana 2010 Tinto Red (Lisboa),"A solid, chunky wine whose tannins are still dominant. It has ripe black fruit flavors and a hint ofspice from wood aging. This is a wine that will develop well over the next 3–5 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
6989,6990,89,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2010 Scharzhofberger Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"There's a brooding quality to the smoky, diesel-fuel like aromas of this wine, but that's left in the rearview by ripe flavors of honey and baked apple once it's in the mouth. This wine is round and atypically soft for the vintage, but picks up some lively lime notes on the finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
6990,6991,89,Talamonti 2007 Tre Saggi  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"Tre Saggi is steadily becoming a representative wine for the Abruzzo region in central Italy. It shows loads of ripe fruit and blackberry, with shadings of spice and leather. That tight, bitter close would pair with succulent grilled meats.",Anonymous,
6991,6992,89,Terre Rouge 2010 Enigma White (Sierra Foothills),"Terre Rouge's yearly blend of Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier is always a delightful wine with food.

6994,6995,89,Viña Casablanca 2009 Nimbus Single Vineyard Syrah (Casablanca Valley),"Opens with lactic, slightly raisiny aromas that turn oakier and creamier with airing. Dense, rubbery and intense on the tongue, with dark flavors of blackberry and herb in the middle. Finishes long, earthy and slightly herbal, with tannic bite and grip. Drink now through 2014.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6995,6996,89,Viña Casablanca 2011 Nimbus Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Light and fresh up front, with lychee, passion fruit and wet stone aromas.

Perfect for summer drinking.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
6996,6997,89,Amalie Robert 2008 Estate Selection Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"As before, the Estate Selection is the bigger of the two Pinots from Amalie, textural and clean. Strawberry and raspberry fruit flavors hint at herb and stem, but all the details are in proportion and complement each other. Not for long aging, but drinking well right now.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine 
6997,6998,89,Caves Transmontanas 2008 Vertice Grand Reserva Tinto Red (Douro),A powerful—possibly too powerful—wine that pushes forward with its superconcentrated black-fruit flavors. It fills the palate with richness and juiciness; this is a wine for lovers of blockbusters.,Roger Voss,@vossroger
6998,6999,89,Cedarville Vineyard 2007 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (El Dorado),"Cedarville takes a lot of pride in its Cab, and this definitely screams mightily of its mountain, granite-soiled origins, with a rich mouthfeel and rocky minerality.

6999,7000,89,Château de Lancyre 2009 Vieilles Vignes Red (Coteaux du Languedoc Pic Saint Loup),"Dark and concentrated but simultaneously fresh and juicy, this blend of 65% Syrah and 35% Grenache offers heady notes of black cherry, plum and raspberry accented by hints of game and tree bark. The meaty, medium-weight palate offers a firm structure and a solid finish.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
7000,7001,89,Terre Rouge 2009 DTR Ranch Syrah (Fiddletown),"The 2009 DTR Syrah won't be available until 2013 and is appropriately still tight, waiting to resolve itself into the superbly structured, bone-dry, savory wine it will become. There's a lot of minerality lurking between walls of black fruit and white pepper spice.",Virginie Boone,@vboone
7001,7002,89,JCB 2010 No. 81 Sonoma Collection Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Lots of zesty, mouthwatering acidity in this Chardonnay. The pineapple, crème brûlée, buttered toast and vanilla flavors are so rich that they require balance, which the zippy acidity provides. Maybe a touch too oaky, but that's a matter of personal preference.",Anonymous,
7002,7003,89,Quinta do Ameal 2010 Ameal S.H. White (Portuguese Table Wine),"This is a rare dessert wine from the Vinho Verde region. It's packed with flavors of currant, lemon honey and orange peel. With its great sense of acidity, it is both sweet and deliciously refreshing.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

It opens with intense aromas of blackberry, black plum and boysenberry that are hit with spicy notes of black pepper, cured meat, leather and Thin Mint. The plush and concentrated palate is like crushed velvet in texture, with gripping yet balanced tannins to support the rich, dense black-fruit flavors.

7006,7007,93,Escarpment 2014 Pahi Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Martinborough),"Plummy yet cool, with a greenish, floral note that adds lift and interest to the dark-fruit aromas and flavors. This is a bit austere and dusty, but long on the finish, so drink 2018–2030.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
7007,7008,93,Gård 2013 Grand Klasse Reserve Lawrence Vineyards Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Brooding aromas of huckleberry, orange peel and flowers are followed by seamless full-bodied palate-coating blue-fruit flavors. It's far from shy but delivers the goods.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
7008,7009,92,Fenestra NV Tawny Port (California),"This sweet, red, fortified wine is labeled as a tawny Port but was not made in Portugal, from where the original Port comes. It offers haunting aromas of cherry compote, molasses and cedar, while flavors suggest cherry sauce, caramel and roasted nuts. A mouth-clinging, thick texture extends the finish for minutes.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars
7009,7010,92,Jérémie Huchet 2015 Clos les Montys 1914 Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"Old vines, some dating from 1914, form the basis of this impressive wine. They give it concentration while the stone and sand soil brings even more richness. With its crisp acidity, lemon and grapefruit fruit, and creamy texture, the wine is refreshing and ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
7010,7011,92,Kerloo 2014 Majestic Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of 54% Grenache (Upland), 38% Mourvèdre (Boushey) and 8% Syrah (Blue Mountain). It shows pure aromas of green herbs, violets, raspberry, black pepper, orange peel and purple fruit. The flavors are pretty, plump and pure, putting a focus on texture, with fruit flavors stretching out on the finish and an orange-peel note running throughout.",Sean P. Sullivan,@wawinereport
7011,7012,92,Mullineux 2014 Old Vines White (Swartland),"This Chenin Blanc-based blend, with 13% Clairette, 10% Viognier and 4% Sémillon, starts off with notes of fresh herbs and verbena, supported by notes of lightly toasted-apple skin, white peach and melon. There's a pleasant roundness to the body, though ample acidity and a lingering clove accent pick up the midpalate and carry through to the lingering finish. Drink now–2020.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
7012,7013,92,N. Kendall Wines 2013 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Laser-edged shards of lime and flint anchor this bright bristling dry Riesling. It's lean and lithe yet penetratingly ripe, offering loads of fresh lemon and quince flavors. The finish is perfumed, marked by notes of smoke and white blossom and a lingering lime pith astringency. Ready to drink now but should age well till 2025.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,
7013,7014,92,Roche de Bellene 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Gevrey-Chambertin),"From a two-acre parcel of vines planted in 1950, this is a finely perfumed, rich wine.

Drink this wine (which is still developing) from 2019.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
7014,7015,92,Roche de Bellene 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"Negociant Nicolas Potel has made a specialty of sourcing old vines. In this wine, they are between 44 and 54-years-old. The wine is rich and concentrated—dark with tannins and generous with black fruits. It is firm and obviously needs to age. Drink this sold wine from 2020.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
7015,7016,92,Roche de Bellene 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Volnay),"Vines planted in 1934 are behind this smooth and concentrated wine.

7016,7017,92,Chalone Vineyard 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Chalone),"Smashed black plums, mulberry and alpine strawberry show through the crushed rocks on the nose of this bottling that is lifted by a tarragon spice. Tangy blackberry and elderberry show on the palate, where wild thyme, oregano and peppercorns contribute to an intriguing sense of depth.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
7017,7018,92,Domaine Grosbois 2014 Clos du Noyer  (Chinon),"This wine comes from a single-parcel, walled vineyard on the north bank of the river Vienne.

The wine will age well, so drink now for the attractive fruit or wait until 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
7018,7019,92,Domaine Vincent Carême 2014 Le Peu Morier  (Vouvray),"The 34-acre vineyard of Tania and Vincent Carême is run organically. This wine, from a parcel of old vines, is dry with signs of its wood aging attractively melding into the apple and spice fruits. With intense acidity and a tight texture, the wine is still fruity and young. It can be drunk now although it is worth waiting until 2022 for a more mature perspective.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
7019,7020,92,Fournier Père et Fils 2013 Grande Cuvée  (Sancerre),"Fournier's top Sancerre wine is released with just that extra bit of maturity, giving it extra depth and richness, and turning the initial fruitiness into something more serious.

7022,7023,92,Bodega Renacer 2013 Renacer R Cabernet Franc (Mendoza),"Dark, dense and ripe from the start, this New World-style Cab Franc is showing raisin, vanilla and foresty aromas prior to a lush soft palate. Flavors of raisin, chocolate and blackberry are on the cusp of overripe and desiccated, while this finishes with flavors of licorice, peppercorn, beef jerky and chocolate. Drink this bulky soft-bodied red now through 2018.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
7023,7024,92,Bodegas Riojanas 2008 Monte Real Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Cherry, plum and oaky aromas of vanilla work well together on this tight, slightly clampy and acidic Gran Reserva that's still showing youthful tannic pull.

7027,7028,92,Villa Maria 2013 Single Vineyard Braided Gravels Merlot (Hawke's Bay),"This Merlot isn't as big or tannic as VM's 2014 Reserve, but it's close in quality. Cedary oak frames Bing cherry fruit on the nose, while the palate delivers a rich, creamy texture and additional complexity in the form of vanilla, licorice and raspberry. The long, velvety finish folds in hints of dark chocolate and espresso. Drink now–2025.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
7028,7029,91,Calera 2008 Reed Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"Calls to mind the 2006, which also was a ripe, fruity wine. If anything, the '08 is even sweeter. The alcohol is half a percent higher. It's succulent in raspberry and cherry jam, making it likeable now. But such are the tannins and acids that the wine should easily gain in the cellar over the next six years.",Anonymous,
7029,7030,91,Elena Walch 2009 Cashmere passito Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige),"Wow, it's hard to beat the aromatic intensity of this Passito Gewürztraminer from cool-climate Alto Adige in northern Italy. The huge bouquet is redolent of pressed yellow flower, jasmine, honey and candied fruit and Indian rose water.",Anonymous,
7030,7031,91,Labouré-Roi 2008 La Futaille  (Gevrey-Chambertin),"A heavily oaked wine that needs time for the toast to integrate. It does have the black fruit structure to back it up, so expect this complex wine to develop pleasurably over the next 5–6 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
7031,7032,91,Lallier 2005 Grand Cru Brut  (Champagne),"While the style is soft, full of yellow fruit richness, the wine also show an excellent concentrated texture. The fresh fruit is integrated into this more complex style. The aftertaste shows some softness, but the wine can certainly age for several years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
7032,7033,91,Monte Rossa NV Prima Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta),This is a lovely sparkling blend with bright citrus notes that add lively accents to the wine's broad base of mature fruit and melon. Acidity on the finish also helps offset its delicious creaminess and richness.,Anonymous,
7033,7034,91,Montes 2007 Alpha M Red (Santa Cruz),"Impressive as always, with dense, meaty aromas of baked black fruits, compost and dried cheese. The palate is thick to the max, with chocolate, coconut and baked plum and berry flavors. Ultrarich on the finish, with warmth and density.

7034,7035,91,Monticello Vineyards 2008 Tietjen Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Impressively rich and ripe in fruit, offering waves of black cherries and chocolate.

So drink between now and 2013 for freshness.",Anonymous,
7035,7036,91,Pierre André 2007 Santenots  (Volnay),"Ripe, sweet-fruited wine, its red berry fruits and opulent tannins giving a rounded feel.

7036,7037,91,Pierre Gaillard 2008 Domaine Cottebrune Transhumance Red (Faugères),"Perhaps better known for his Côte-Rôties, Pierre Gaillard is obviously comfortable working with schist. Transhumance is an intense and complex wine, with assertive notes of kirsch, sweet smoke, wild game and garrigue accents of thyme, rosemary and violet. Rich and lush in the mouth, the texture is like crushed velvet and the finish evolves from a dark fruit blast to sweet vanilla bean and finally ending on a smoked cedar and spice note.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz
7037,7038,91,Storybook Mountain 2008 Mayacamas Range Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Mountain-grown fruit gives this wine an exceptional intensity and purity of flavor. Tastes like the essence of blackberries, sprinkled with black pepper, anise and cocoa. As rich as it is, the finish is perfectly dry. There's a rusticity to the texture, but that's why Zinfandel is Zinfandel. Drink over the next six years, especially with barbecue or fine roasted meats and root vegetables.",Anonymous,
7038,7039,91,Domaine du Chalet Pouilly 2009 Eléve en Fûts de Chêne  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"Rich, creamy wood-aged wine that shows pear, apple and toast flavors ane even a hint of honey. Smooth and textured, it has fine final spice and acidity to add further interest.",Roger Voss,@vossroger

7041,7042,91,Vincent Sauvestre 2009 Clos des Tessons  (Meursault),"A beautifully ripe and rounded wood-aged wine.

The wood flavors are beginning to blend into the lychee and peach flavors, promising an even richer experience in a few months.",Roger Voss,@vossroger
7042,7043,91,Quadra 2006 Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta),"This Chardonnay-based Satèn sparkling wine opens with creamy aromas of vanilla, lemon custard, apricot and dried sage. The wine has a smooth, rich and persistent character thanks to the delicate quality of its perlage.",Anonymous,
7043,7044,91,Aresti 2007 Family Collection Red (Curicó Valley),"This wine has traveled miles in the right direction compared to its early incarnations.

7044,7045,91,Bodega Catena Zapata 2008 Adrianna Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),"Graphite and lead pencil aromas mix with toasty berry scents.

Deep and solid on the finish, but it trails behind Adrianna wines from recent vintages.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
7045,7046,91,Bodega Catena Zapata 2008 Argentino Malbec (Mendoza),"A sniff is rewarded with sandalwood, dry spice and thick, jammy berry aromas.

Seems a touch flat and candied on the finish, with a final blast of sweetness.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
7046,7047,87,Highway 12 2006 Reserve Red (Sonoma Valley),"Give this Bordeaux blend a good, long decant before you pour. It's tight and young in tannins and acids, and the blackberry, cherry and currant flavors have a jammy edge. It's a well-made wine despite the rugged mouthfeel. Based on Merlot, its future is entirely unpredictable.",Anonymous,
7047,7048,87,Tres Vinicultores 2008 The Central Late Harvest Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Quite good, but some vegetal flavors mar this dessert wine, which is very sweet, with 18% residual sugar. Such sweetness is usually enough to satisfy on its own, but despite the apricot, tangerine and vanilla flavors, a stubborn green streak lowers the score.",Anonymous,
7048,7049,87,Trivento 2009 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza),"Quite bright, sweet and fruity, with a hint of cherry candy and blackberry on the bouquet and then a juicy, fresh palate with mild chocolate, raspberry and proper texture.

7053,7054,87,Hugh Hamilton 2009 The Mongrel Sangiovese Blend Sangiovese (McLaren Vale),"A lively, medium-bodied dry red for casual meals, this is a good example of Australian Sangiovese.

It's 85% Sangiovese, with the balance Merlot and Shiraz.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz
7054,7055,87,:Nota Bene 2007 Miscela Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A Bordeaux blend dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, the Miscela starts strong with a complex bouquet of black fruits, toast, smoke, coffee grounds and pencil shavings. The alcohol, listed at 15.4%, does not intrude, yet somehow it seems to mute the complexity. As a result, the finish turns astringent, drying, with a layer of ash drifting over the fruit.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine

7062,7063,82,Cougar 2014 Estate Cask Reserve Sangiovese (Temecula Valley),"Light in the glass, this bottling is quite funky on the nose with reductive red cherry and tar notes. Flavors are sour, full of tart cherry and composting earth tones.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann
7063,7064,82,Santa Ema 2014 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),"From the outset this is woody and artificial in style. Aromas of milk chocolate and clove are strange and forced. In the mouth, this feels wiry but also gummy, with clove-heavy oak and tannic bite. In general, this is overly woody, candied and seemingly not natural.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
7064,7065,82,François Lurton 2015 Hacienda Araucano Clos de Lolol White (Lolol Valley),"This yellow-tinted blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay smells more like freshly waxed floorboards and wood resin than fruit.

7065,7066,82,Apaltagua NV Extra Brut Costero Sparkling (San Antonio),"Grassy aromas include a note of crushed vitamin. This is basic at best, lacking at worst. There's not much to the palate, while salty grassy grapefruit flavors fail to stir excitement. An unfriendly note of onion appears on a tart green finish.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
7066,7067,81,Echeverria 2016 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"With a strange pink color and powdery nondescript aromas, this is shapeless and lacking in structure. Weak bitter flavors are completely fruitless; overall this seems to be going nowhere good.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
7067,7068,81,Valdivieso NV Brut Sparkling (Chile),"This tan-colored brut is outright oxidized and bready from front to tail. A foamy full palate is awkward, while this tastes yeasty and stale, as oxidized wines often do.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
7068,7069,81,Finca Patagonia 2015 Expedicion Pinot Noir (Maule Valley),"Aromas of chewing gum dust are not attractive. This feels flat, with zero edge and structure. Lightly oxidized flavors of generic berry leave one with nothing to latch on to.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
7069,7070,81,Santa Rita 2015 Secret Reserve Pinot Noir (Central Valley),"A blast of fake-smelling clove is the dominant aroma on this sticky Pinot Noir. Clove returns as the singular flavor, while the finish is woody but not toasty or classy. This is uniquely one-dimensional, but in the wrong way.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
7070,7071,80,Casas del Toqui 2015 Barrel Series Reserva Pinot Noir (Cachapoal Valley),"Rusty in color, with aromas of compost and rotten leaves, this isn't cutting it. A drawing hard palate and burnt-out flavors that match the nose make this a hard road to navigate.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
7071,7072,80,Loma Larga 2011 Brut Nature Limited Edition Cabernet Franc (Casablanca Valley),"Other than a strange note of mustard, there's little to say about the nose of this brut nature Cab Franc.

7075,7076,96,Alta Vista 2013 Single Vineyard Temis Malbec (Mendoza),"Just when you think Alta Vista has gotten everything it can from Temis (see the 2012), this comes along to reset the benchmark. Ripe, round and lush on the nose, with full-force blackberry and prune aromas, this shows titanic grip, depth and ripeness on the palate. Flavors of raisin, chocolate and blackberry finish with hefty tannins and a smear of mocha flavor. Drink from 2018–2026.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach
7076,7077,96,K Vintners 2012 The Hustler Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a unicorn wine that only gets made in exceptional years—the last time was a decade ago.

7078,7079,96,Colombera & Garella 2013 Pizzaguerra  (Lessona),"This stunning red is all about finesse and light. It opens with lovely scents of violet, rose, perfumed berry and balsamic aromas while the radiant, almost ethereal palate delivers crunchy red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and mineral intensity.

7083,7084,96,Quinta do Noval 2014 Vintage  (Port),"This beautifully perfumed wine has all the tannins that will allow it to age over many decades. It also offers the rich blackberry, dark plum and great structure that will support that aging. As so often, Noval has released a vintage when other major producers have held back.

7167,7168,92,Raphael 2013 Reserve Petit Verdot (North Fork of Long Island),"Plush, lip-staining blueberries and blackberries permeate through this rich, inky-black Petit Verdot.
